    <h2>
      I. &mdash; THE EXODUS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the Calle Las Gabias&mdash;one of those by-streets of Lisbon below St.
      Catherine&mdash;there occurred one New Year a little event in the
      Synagogue there worth a mention in this history of Richard, Lord of the
      Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Kol Nidrè, eve of the Day of Atonement, and the little Beth-El,
      sweltering in a dingy air, was transacting the long-drawn liturgy, when,
      behind the curtain where the women sat, an old dame who had been gazing
      upward smote her palms together, and let slip a little scream: &ldquo;The Day is
      coming...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She then fainted, and till near ten lay on her bed, lit by the Yom Kippur
      candle, with open eyes, but without speech, her sere face still beautiful,
      on each temple a little pyramid of plaits, with gold-and-coral ear-rings:
      a holy <i>belle.</i> About ten P.M. three women watching heard her murmur:
      &ldquo;My child, Rebekah...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was childless, and whom she meant was not known. However, soon
      afterwards there was a form at the amulet-guarded door, and Estrella sat
      up, saying: &ldquo;Rebekah, my child...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A young lady of twenty-two ran in and embraced her, saying: &ldquo;I have been
      to Paris and Madrid with my father&mdash;just arrived, so flew to see you.
      We leave for London to-night&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No: I shall keep you seven days. Tell Frankl <i>I</i> say so. What
      jewels! You have grown into a rose of glory, the eyes are profounder and
      blacker, and that brow was made for high purpose. Tell me&mdash;have you a
      lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mamma Estrella&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why the blush?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing at all,&rdquo; Miss Frankl answered: &ldquo;five years ago when at
      school in Bristol I thrice saw through a grating a young man with whom I
      was frivolous enough to speak. Happily, I do not know what has become of
      him&mdash;a wild, divine kind of creature, of whom I am well rid, and
      never likely to see again&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady mused. &ldquo;What was he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sailor&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a common sailor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fancy so, mamma&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth&mdash;Richard&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Jew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An Englishman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, as the old lady's eyes opened in sacred horror, and as she
      whispered: &ldquo;Child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Within three months of that night, one midnight the people of Prague rose
      and massacred most of the Jewish residents; the next day the flame broke
      out in Buda-Pesth; and within a week had become a revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the twelfth morning one of two men in a City bank said to the other:
      &ldquo;Come, Frankl, you cannot fail a man in this crisis&mdash;I only want
      80,000 on all Westring&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good to me, my lord,&rdquo; answered Frankl, who, though a man of only forty&mdash;short,
      with broad shoulders,&mdash;already had his skin divided up like a dry
      leaf; in spite of which, he was handsome, with a nose ruled straight and
      long, a black beard on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the telephone rattled and Frankl heard these words at the receiver:
      &ldquo;Wire to hand from Wertheimer: Austrian Abgeordneten-haus passed a
      Resolution at noon virtually expelling Jewish Race....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Frankl turned again he had already resolved to possess Westring Vale,
      and was saying to himself: &ldquo;Within six months the value of English land
      should be&mdash;doubled&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bargain was soon made now: and within one week the foresight of Frankl
      began to be justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Austria, during those days, was a nation of vengeful hearts: for the Jews
      had acquired half its land, and had mortgages on the other half: peasant,
      therefore, and nobleman flamed alike. And this fury was contagious: now
      Germany&mdash;now France had it&mdash;Anti-Semite laws&mdash;like the old
      May-Laws&mdash;but harsher still; and streaming they came, from the
      Leopoldstadt, from Bukowina, from the Sixteen Provinces, from all Galicia,
      from the Nicolas Colonies, from Lisbon, with wandering foot and weary
      breast&mdash;the Heines, Cohens, Oppenheimers&mdash;Sephardim,
      Aschkenasim. And Dover was the new Elim.
    </p>
    <p>
      With alarm Britain saw them come! but before she could do anything, the
      wave had overflowed it; and by the time it was finished there was no
      desire to do anything: for within eight months such a tide of prosperity
      was floating England as has hardly been known in a country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason of this was the increased number of hands&mdash;each making
      more things than its owner could consume himself, and so making every
      other richer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came, however, a change&mdash;almost suddenly&mdash;due to the new
      demand for land, the &ldquo;owners&rdquo; determining to await still further rises,
      before letting. This checked industry: for now people, debarred from the
      land, had only air.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Westring Vale, as everywhere, times were hard. It was now the property
      of Baruch Frankl: for at the first failure of Lord Westring to meet terms,
      Frankl had struck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, one of the yeomen of Westring was a certain Richard Hogarth.

    </div>
    <h2>
      II. &mdash; THE FEZ
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frankl took up residence at Westring in September, and by November every
      ale-house, market, and hiring in Westring had become a scene of
      discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cause was this: Frankl had sent out to his tenants a Circular
      containing the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...tenants to use for wear in the Vale a <i>fez with tassel</i> as the
      Livery of the Manor...the will of the Lord of the Manor...no exception...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But though intense, the excitement was not loud: for want was in many a
      home; though after three weeks there were still six farmers who resisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it happened one day that five of these at the Martinmas &ldquo;Mop,&rdquo; or
      hiring, were discussing the matter, when they spied the sixth boring his
      way, and one exclaimed: &ldquo;Yonder goes Hogarth! Let's hear what <i>he's</i>
      got to say!&rdquo; and set to calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth twisted, and came winning his way, taller than the crowd, with
      &ldquo;What's up? Hullo, Clinton&mdash;not a moment to spare to-day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We were a-talking about that Circular&mdash;!&rdquo; cried one.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment two other men joined the group: one a dark-skinned Jew of
      the Moghrabîm; the other a young man&mdash;an English author&mdash;on
      tour. And these two heard what passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth stood suspended, finding no words, till one cried: &ldquo;Do you mean to
      put the cap on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laughed a little now. &ldquo;<i>I!</i> The whip! The whip!&rdquo;&mdash;he showed
      his hunting-crop, and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      His manner of speech was rapid, and he had a hoarse sort of voice, almost
      as of sore-throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two not farmers, one&mdash;the author&mdash;enquired as to his
      name, and farm; the other man&mdash;the Moghrabîm Jew&mdash;that evening
      recounted to Frankl the words which he had heard.

    <p>
      One afternoon, two weeks later, Loveday, the author, was leaning upon a
      stile, talking to Margaret Hogarth; and he said: &ldquo;I love you! If you could
      <i>deign</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth is,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are in love with my brother, Dick, and you
      think it is me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was a woman of twenty-five, large and buxom, though neat-waisted, her
      face beautifully fresh and wholesome, and he of middle-size, with a lazy
      ease of carriage, small eyes set far apart, a blue-velvet jacket, duck
      trousers very dirty, held up by a belt, a red shirt, an old cloth hat, a
      careless carle, greatly famed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it isn't of your brother, but of <i>you</i>, that I am wanting to
      speak! Tell me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I can't. I am a frivolous old woman to be talking to you about
      such things at all! But, since it is as you say, wait, perhaps I may be
      able&mdash;But I must be going now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was embarrassment in her now: and suddenly she walked away, going to
      meet&mdash;another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed through stubble-wheat, disappeared in a pine-wood, and came out
      upon the Waveney towing-path. On the towing-path came Frankl to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took her hand, holding his head sideward with a cajoling fondness,
      wearing the flowing caftan, and a velvet cap which widened out a-top, with
      puckers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sweetheart...&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, you know, I begged you not to use such words to me!&rdquo;&mdash;from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, and I who am such a sweetheart of yours?&rdquo;&mdash;his speech very
      foreign, yet slangily correct, being, in fact, <i>all</i> slang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you spoke different at first, and that is why&mdash;But
      this must be the last, unless you say out clearly now what it is you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you are too hard. You know I am wild in love with you. And so are
      you with me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;with shrinking modesty in her under-looking eyes. &ldquo;Oh,
      no&mdash;don't have any delusions like that about me, please! You said
      that you liked me: and as I am in the habit of speaking the truth myself,
      I thought that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;But my meeting you, to be frank with
      you, was for the sake of my brother&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are as candid as they make them,&rdquo; he said, eyeing her with his
      mild eye. &ldquo;But what's the matter with your brother? Hard up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's worried about something&rdquo;. &ldquo;He must have some harvest-money put
      away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has something in Reid's Bank at Yarmouth, I believe&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, shall I tell you what's the matter with him? He's <i>afraid</i>,
      your brother. He has refused to wear the cap, and he thinks that I shall
      be down upon him like a thousand of bricks...But suppose I exempt him, and
      you and I be friends? That's fair&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give us <i>one</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Believe me, you talk&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let your angry passions rise. I am going to have a kiss off those
      handsome lips&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before she could stir he was in the act of the embrace; but it was never
      accomplished: for he saw her colour fade, heard crackling twigs, a step!
      as someone emerged from the wood ten yards away&mdash;Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought in Margaret's mind was this: &ldquo;Father in Heaven, whatever will
      he think of me here with this Jew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth stopped, staring at this couple; did not understand: Margaret
      should have been home from &ldquo;class-meeting&rdquo;...only, he observed her heaving
      bosom; then twisted about and went, his walk rapid, in his hand a
      hunting-crop, by which, with a very sure aim, he batted away pebbles from
      his path, stooping each time.

    <h2>
      III. &mdash; THE HUNTING-CROP
    </h2>
    <p>
      Along the towing-path to the farmhouse. He did not look behind: was like a
      man who has received a wound, and wonders whence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A pallor lay under his brown skin, brown almost as an Oriental's, and he
      was called &ldquo;the Black Hogarth&rdquo;&mdash;the Hogarths being Saxon, on the
      mantel in the dining-room being a very simple coat&mdash;a Bull on Gules.
      But Richard was a startling exception. His hair grew away flat and sparse
      from his round brow; on his cheeks three moles, jet-black in their centre.
      Handsome one called his hairless face: the nose delicate, the lips negroid
      in their thick pout, the left eye red, streaked with bloodshot, the eyes'
      brown brightness very beautiful and strange, with a sideward stare wild as
      that sideward stare of the race-horse; and the lids had a way of lifting
      largely anon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through Lagden Dip orchard into the old homestead, into the
      dining-room, where cowered the old Hogarth, smoking, his hair a mist of
      wool-white.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up, but said nothing; and Richard said nothing, but walked
      about, his arms folded, frowning turbulently, while the twilight deepened,
      and Margaret did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he planted a chair near the old man, sat, and shouted: &ldquo;Listen, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up went the old Hogarth's hand to push forward the inquiring ear, while
      Richard, who, till now, had guarded him from all knowledge of the
      Circular, snatched it from his breast-pocket, and loudly read.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sense entered his head, up the old man shot his palms, shaking from
      them astonishment and deprecation, with nods; then, with opening arms, and
      an under-look at Richard: &ldquo;Well, there is nothing to be said: the land is
      his....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth leapt up and walked out; he muttered: &ldquo;The land is his, but he is
      mine....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question at the bottom of his mind had been this: &ldquo;Does <i>Margaret</i>,
      too, go with the land?&rdquo; But he did not utter it even to himself: went out,
      fingering the crop, stalking toward the spot where he had left the man and
      the woman. But Margaret was then coming through the wood; Frankl had gone
      up to the Hall; and Hogarth crossed the bridge and went climbing toward
      the mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Friday evening, and up at the Hall the Sabbath had commenced, two
      Sabbath-tapers shining now upon the Mezuzzah at the dining-room door,
      Frankl being of the Cohanîm, the priestly class&mdash;a Jew of Jews. As he
      had passed in, two Moghrabîm Jews had saluted him with: &ldquo;Shabbath&rdquo;; and
      mildly he had replied: &ldquo;Shabbath&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But swift upon his steps strode Hogarth: Hogarth was at the lodge-gates&mdash;was
      on the drive&mdash;was in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, since Frankl was just preparing to celebrate the <i>kiddush</i>, &ldquo;He
      cannot be seen now&rdquo;, said a man in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He must&rdquo;, said Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he brushed past, two men raised an outcry: but Hogarth continued his
      swift way, and had half traversed a <i>salon</i> hung with a chaos of
      cut-glass when from a side-door appeared the inquiring face of Frankl in
      pious skull-cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot be seen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He recognized the man of the towing-path, and on his face grew a look of
      scare, as he backed toward a study: but before he could slam the door,
      Hogarth, too, was within.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you? What is it?&rdquo; whined Frankl, who was both hard master and
      cringing slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth produced the Circular: but of Margaret not a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Caps-and-tassels, you?&rdquo;&mdash;flicking Frankl on the cheek with a fillip
      of his middle finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare assault me! Why, I swear, I meant no harm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Down came the whip upon the Jew's shoulders, Frankl, as the stings
      penetrated his caftan, giving out one roar, and the next instant, seeing
      the two Jews at the doorway, groaned the mean whisper: &ldquo;Oh, don't make a
      man look small before the servants&rdquo;, crying out immediately: &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon five or six servants were at the door, and, of these, two Arab Jews
      rushed forward, one a tall fellow, the other an obese bulk with bright
      black eyes, the former holding a slender blade&mdash;the knife with which
      &ldquo;shechita&rdquo;, or slaughtering, was done: and while the corpulent Jew threw
      himself upon Hogarth, the other drew this knife through the flesh of
      Hogarth's shoulder, at the same time happening to cut the heavy Arab
      across the wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there was some quarrel between the two Arabs, and the injured Arab,
      forgetting Hogarth, turned fiercely upon his fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, meanwhile, had not let go Frankl, nor delivered the intended
      number of cuts: so he was again standing with uplifted whip, when his eye
      happened to fall upon the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw there a sight which struck his arm paralysed: Rebekah Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two months had she been here at Westring&mdash;and he had not known it!
    </p>
    <p>
      There she stood peering, of a divine beauty in his eyes, like
      half-mythical queens of Egypt and Babylon, blinking in a rather barbarous
      superfluity of jewels: and, blinded and headlong, he was in flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Frankl, he locked that door upon himself, and remained there,
      forgetting the sanctification of the Sabbath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hebrew's eyes blazed like a wild beast's. The words: &ldquo;As the Lord
      liveth...&rdquo; hissed in whispers from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took up a pinch of old ashes, and cast it into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Shimei, the son of Gera, cursed David, so he cursed Richard Hogarth
      that night&mdash;again and again&mdash;with grave rites, with cancerous
      rancour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will blight him, as the Lord liveth; as the Lord liveth, I will blight
      him...&rdquo; he said repeatedly, his draperied arms spread in pompous
      imprecation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a beginning, he sat and wrote to Reid's Bank, requesting the payment in
      gold of £14,000&mdash;to produce a stoppage of payment at the little Bank
      in which were Richard's savings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, with mild eyes he repaired to the dining-hall, and sanctified
      the Sabbath, blessing a cup of wine, dividing up two napkined loaves, and
      giving to Rebekah his benediction.

    <h2>
      IV. &mdash; THE SWOON
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hogarth went moodily down the hillside to the Waveney, across the bridge,
      and home, his sleeve stained with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the dining-room, he threw himself into an easy-chair in a gloom lit
      only by the fireglow, in the room above mourning a little harmonium which
      Margaret was playing, mixed with the sound of Loveday's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man said: &ldquo;Richard, my boy...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, I have somewhat to say to you&mdash;are ye hearkening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Richard, losing blood, moaned a drowsy &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the old Hogarth, all deaf and bedimmed, said: &ldquo;I had to say it to you,
      and this night let it be: Richard, you are no son of mine&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point Hogarth's head dropped forward: but many a time, during long
      years, he remembered a dream in which he had heard those words: &ldquo;Richard,
      you are no son of mine...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old Hogarth continued to ears that did not hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have kept it from you&mdash;for I'm under a bargain with a firm of
      solicitors in London; but, Dick, it doesn't strike me as I am long for
      this world: a queer feeling I've had in this left side the last hour or
      two; and there's that Circular&mdash;I never heard of such a thing in all
      my born days. But what can we do? You'll have to wear the cap&mdash;or be
      turned out. Always I've said to myself, from a young man: 'Get hold of a
      bit of land someways as your own God's own': but I never did; the days
      went by and by, and it all seems no longer than an after-dinner nap in a
      barn on a hot harvest-day. But a bit of land&mdash;the man who has that
      can make all the rest work to keep him. And if they turn me out, I
      couldn't live, lad: the old house has got into my bones, somehow. Anyhow,
      I think the time is come to tell you in my own way how the thing was. No
      son are you of mine, Richard. Your mother, Rachel, who was a Londoner,
      served me an ill turn while we were sweethearting, hankering after another
      man&mdash;a Jew millionaire he was, she being a governess in his house;
      but, Richard, I couldn't give her up: I married her three months before
      you were born; and not a living creature knows, except, perhaps, one&mdash;perhaps
      one: a priest he was, called O'Hara. But that's how it was. Your father
      was a Jew, and your mother was a Jew, and you are a Jew, and in the
      under-bottom of the old grey trunk you will find a roll of papers. Are you
      hearkening? And don't you be ashamed of being a Jew, boy&mdash;<i>they</i>
      are the people who've got the money; and money buys land, Richard. Nor
      your father did not do so badly by you, either: his name was Spinoza&mdash;Sir
      Solomon Spinoza&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that point Margaret, bearing a lamp, entered, followed by Loveday, and
      at the sight of Richard uttered a cry.
    </p>

    </div>
    <h2>
      V. &mdash; REID'S
    </h2>
    <p>
      By noon Hogarth knew the news: his hundred and fifty at Reid's were gone;
      and he owed for the Michaelmas quarter&mdash;twenty-one pounds five, his
      only chattels of value being the thresher, not yet paid for, half a rick,
      seed, manure, and &ldquo;the furniture&rdquo;. If he could realize enough for rent, he
      would lack capital for wages and cultivation, for Reid's had been his
      credit-bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner he stood long at a window, then twisted away, and walked to
      Thring, where he captained in a football match, Loveday watching his rage,
      his twisting waist, and then accompanying him home: but in the dining-room
      they found the lord-of-the-manor's bailiff; and Loveday, divining
      something embarrassing, took himself away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same evening there were two appraisers in the house, and the bailiff,
      on their judgment, took possession of the chattels on the holding except
      some furniture, and some agricultural &ldquo;fixtures&rdquo;. The sale was arranged
      for the sixth day.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the old Hogarth the truth could no longer be hidden...
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days he continued quiet in the old nook by the hearth, apparently in a
      kind of dotage doze; but on the third, he began to poke about, hobbled
      into the dairy, peered into the churn, touched the skimmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to wear the cap&rdquo;, Margaret heard him mutter&mdash;&ldquo;or be
      turned out&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if taking farewell, he would get up, as at a sudden thought, to go to
      visit something. He kept murmuring: &ldquo;I always said, Get a bit of land as
      your own, but I never did; the days went by and by....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, meantime, was busy, binding beds with sheets, making bundles,
      preparing for the flitting, with a heaving breast; till, on the fifth day,
      a van stood loaded with their things at the hall-door, and she, with
      untidy hair, was helping heave the last trunk upon the backboard, when the
      carman said: &ldquo;Mrs. Mackenzie says, mum, the things mustn't be took to the
      cottage, except you pay in advance&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Margaret stood at a loss; but in a minute went bustling, deciding to
      go to Loveday, not without twinges of reluctance: for Loveday, with
      instinctive delicacy, had lately kept from the farm; and to Margaret,
      whose point of view was different, the words &ldquo;false friends&rdquo; had occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through an alley of the forest, she was met by a man&mdash;a
      park-keeper of Frankl's&mdash;a German Jew, who had once handed her a note
      from Frankl. And he, on seeing her, said: &ldquo;Here have I a letter for your
      brother&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who from?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may I not say&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he handed her an envelope rather stuffed with papers, she went on her
      flurried way; and soon Loveday was bowing before her in his sitting-room
      at Priddlestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be surprised to see me, Mr. Loveday,&rdquo; said she, panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little surprised, but most awfully glad, too. Is all well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, far from that, I'm afraid. But I haven't got any time&mdash;and, oh
      my, I don't know how to say it,&mdash;but to be frank with you&mdash;could
      you lend Richard two pounds&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loveday coloured to the roots of his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not tell her: &ldquo;Open that envelope in your hand&rdquo;, for that would
      have meant that it was he who had sent the £50 it contained; and he had
      now only one sixpence in Priddlestone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is&rdquo;, she said&mdash;&ldquo;if it is not an inconvenience to you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could find no words. Some fifteen minutes before, having enclosed the
      notes, he had descended to the bar to get mine host to find him a
      messenger, and direct the envelope&mdash;for Hogarth knew his handwriting.
      Mine host was not there&mdash;his wife could not write: but she had
      pointed out the Jewish park-keeper sipping beer; so Loveday had had the
      man upstairs, had made him write the address, and had bribed him to
      deliver the envelope with a mum tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I've taken a great liberty&mdash;&rdquo; she said, shrinking at his
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke: &ldquo;Oh, liberty!&mdash;but&mdash;really&mdash;I'm quite broke
      myself&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, good-afternoon to you&rdquo;, said she: &ldquo;I am very sorry&mdash;but you
      will excuse the liberty, won't you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the forest she began to cry, covering her eyes, moaning: &ldquo;Why, how
      could he be so <i>mean</i>? And I who loved that young man with all my
      heart, God knows&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes searched the ground for two sovereigns. Then she happened to look
      at the envelope: and instantly was interested. &ldquo;Why, it is the Jew's
      hand!&rdquo; she thought, for the letters were angular in the German manner,
      making a general similarity with Frankl's writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity overcame her: she opened, and saw...
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, this is <i>generous</i> though, after all!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she ran, coming out from mossy path upon wide forest-road: and
      there, taking promenade, was Frankl, quite near, with phylacteried left
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, sweetheart...&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped before him. &ldquo;Well, you can call me what you like for the time
      being&rdquo;, said she, laughing rather hysterically; &ldquo;for I am most grateful to
      you for your generous present to my brother, Mr. Frankl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had still no suspicion of Richard's visit of chastisement to the Hall!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what do you mean?&rdquo; said Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you might guess that I know your handwriting by this time!&rdquo; she said
      coquettishly, and held out the notes and the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes twinkled; he meditated; he had, more than ever, need of her; and
      he said: &ldquo;Well, you are as 'cute as they make them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But instead of sending us this, which I am not at all sure that Richard
      will touch, why couldn't you pay it to yourself, and not turn us out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I let business take its course: and afterwards I do my charity. But it
      wasn't for your brother, you know, that I sent it&mdash;but for <i>you</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must be running&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the farm, she gave the carman a secret glimpse of the
      notes, while Hogarth, who was now there, went to seek the old Hogarth, for
      whom a nest had been made among the furniture in the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was found above-stairs in an empty room, searching the floor for
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, sir&rdquo;, said Hogarth, and led him step by step.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the old man passed the threshold, he fell flat on the slabs of the
      porch, striking his forehead, printing a stain there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the next day, the day of the sale, he still lay in the old chamber, on
      the ancient bed, dead.

    <h2>
      VI. &mdash; &ldquo;PEARSON'S WEEKLY&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rose Cottage&rdquo; was without roses: but had a good-sized &ldquo;garden&rdquo; at the
      back; and here Hogarth soon had a shed nailed together, with bellows,
      anvil, sledges, rasps, setts, drifts, and so on, making a little smithy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He engaged a boy; and soon John Loveday would be leaning all a forenoon at
      the shed door, watching the lithe ply of Hogarth's hips, and the white-hot
      iron gushing flushes; while Margaret, peeping, could see Loveday's
      slovenly ease of pose, his numberless cigarettes, and hear the rhymes of
      the sledges chiming.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Loveday's £50, she had dared to say nothing to Richard, but kept
      them, intending to make up the amount already spent, and give them to
      Frankl. Loveday, meantime, she avoided with constant care.
    </p>
    <p>
      So two weeks passed, till, one day, Loveday, leaning at the forge-door,
      happened to say: &ldquo;Are you interested in current politics? The East Norfolk
      division is being contested, one of the candidates, Sir Bennett Beaumont,
      is a friend of mine, and I was thinking that I might go to the meeting
      to-night, if you could come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I invite you to supper here instead&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not interested?&rdquo; queried Loveday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Stop&mdash;I'll show you something in which I <i>am</i>
      interested&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran to a corner, picked up a <i>Pearson's Weekly</i>, and pointed to a
      paragraph headed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FIVE HUNDRED-POUND NOTES!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;FIFTY TEN-POUND NOTES!!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ONE HUNDRED FIVE-POUND NOTES!!!&rdquo; &mdash;a prize for &ldquo;the most
      intelligent&rdquo; article, explaining the cause, or causes, of &ldquo;the present
      distress and commercial crisis&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loveday read it smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;but who is to be the judge of 'the most intelligent'
      article? Pearson must himself be of the highest intelligence to decide&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True&rdquo;, said Hogarth. &ldquo;But the man who offered that prize has indicated to
      the nation the thing which it should be doing. If I was able to form an
      Association to enter this competition&mdash;and why not? Stop&mdash;I will
      go with you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So that evening they walked to Beccles, and took train for Yarmouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The candidate to speak was a Mr. Moses Max, a Liberal Jew; the chair to be
      taken by Baruch Frankl; and in the midst of a row, the stately great men
      entered upon the platform and occupied it, hisses like the escape of steam
      mixing with &ldquo;He's a jolly good fellow&rdquo;. Midway down the pit sat Loveday,
      and with him Hogarth, whose large stare ranged solemnly round and down
      from galleries to floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl sipped water, and rose, amid shouts of: &ldquo;Circular!&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Caps-and-tassels!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a speech of which nothing was known, except the amiable bows, for
      a continual noising filled the hall; and up rose Mr. Moses Max, a stout
      fair Jew, whose fist struck with a regular, heavy emphasis. After ten
      minutes, when he began to be heard, he was saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...Sir Bennett Beaumont! Is <i>he</i> the sort of man you'd send to
      represent you? (Cries of: &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;) What is he?&mdash;ask yourselves the
      question: a fossilized Tory, a man who's about as much idea of progress as
      a mummy&mdash;people actually say he's <i>got</i> a collection of mummies
      in his grand fashionable mansion at Aylesham, and it's only what we should
      expect of him. (Cheers, and cries of: &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo;) And what has he ever done
      for East Norfolk? Gentlemen, you may say as you like about Jews&mdash;Jews
      this, and Jews that&mdash;and every man has a right to his opinion in this
      land of glorious Saxon liberty&mdash;but no one can deny that it's Jews
      who know how to make the money. (Cheers and hisses.) They know how to make
      it for themselves (hisses)&mdash;and, yes, they know how to make it for
      the nation! (Loud triumph of cheers.) <i>That's</i> the point&mdash;<i>that</i>
      touches the spot! (Cries of: &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo;) Righteousness, it is said,
      exalteth a nation: well, so do Jews&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is false&rdquo;, said a voice&mdash;Hogarth, who had stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were the signal for a shower of cheers swept by gusts of hisses;
      and immediately one region of the pit was seen to be a scrimmage of
      fisticuffs, mixed with policemen, sticks, savage faces, and bent backs;
      while the two galleries, craning to see, bellowed like Bashan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moses Max was leaning wildly, gesticulating, with shouts; while Loveday,
      who had turned pale on Hogarth's rising, touched Hogarth's coat-tail,
      whereupon Hogarth, stooping to his ear, shouted: &ldquo;We will have some
      fun...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The paid agents of Beaumont!&rdquo; now shouted Moses Max; &ldquo;sent to disturb our
      meeting! Englishmen! will you submit to this? The nation shall hear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that point Moses Max, in his gesticulation, happening to touch a switch
      in the platform-rail, out glowered into darkness every light at that end
      of the hall: at which thing the audience was thrown into a state of
      boisterous lawlessness, a tumult reigning in the gloom like the constant
      voice of Niagara, until suddenly the platform was again lit up, and the
      uproar lulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now again Moses Max was prone to speak, with lifted fist; but before
      ever he could utter one single word, a voice was ringing through the
      Assembly Rooms:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Where</i> was Moses when the light went out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This again was Hogarth; and it ended Moses Max for that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth had not sat since he had called out &ldquo;That is false&rdquo;: his tall
      figure was recognized; and, with that electric spontaneity of crowds, he
      was straightway the leader of the meeting, men darting from their seats
      with waving hats, sticks, arms, and vociferous mouth, the chairman half
      standing, with a shivering finger directed upon Hogarth, shrieking to the
      police: but too late&mdash;Hogarth had brushed past Loveday's knees&mdash;was
      dashing for the crowded platform-steps&mdash;was picking his way,
      stumbling, darting up them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crumpled in his hand was a <i>Pearson's Weekly</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he is to the front&mdash;near Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends! I have ventured to take the place of our friend, Moses, here&mdash;no
      ill-will to him&mdash;for with respect to the question before us, whether
      we elect Beaumont or Max, I care, I confess, little. I'm rather an
      Anti-Jew myself (hissing and cheers), but it strikes me that the Jews are
      the least of our trouble. To a man who said to me that the cause of all
      our evil days is the inability of England to feed these few million Jews
      I'd answer: &ldquo;I don't know how you can be so silly!&rdquo; Why, the whole human
      race, friends, can find room on the Isle of Wight&mdash;the earth laughs
      at the insignificant drawings upon her made by the small infantry called
      Man. Then, why do we suffer, friends? We <i>do</i> suffer, I suppose? I
      was once at Paris, and at a place called 'the Morgue' I saw exposed young
      men with wounded temples, and girls with dead mouths twisted, and innocent
      old women drowned; and there must be a biggish cry, you know, rising each
      night from the universal earth, accusing some hoary fault in the way men
      live together! What is the fault? If you ask <i>me</i>, I answer that I am
      only a common smith: <i>I</i> don't know: but I know this about the fault,
      that it is something simple, commonplace, yet deep-seated, or we should
      all see it; but it is hidden from us by its very ordinariness, like the
      sun which men seldom look at. It <i>must</i> be so. And shall we never
      find the time to think of it? Or will never some grand man, mighty as a
      garrison, owning eyes that know the glances of Truth, arise to see for us?
      Friends! but, lacking him, what shall we do to be saved?&mdash;for truly
      this 'civilization' of ours is a blood-washed civilization, friends, a
      reddish Juggernaut, you know, whose wheels cease not: so we should be
      prying into it, provided we be not now too hide-bound: for that's the
      trouble&mdash;that our thoughts grow to revolve in stodgy grooves of
      use-and-wont, and shun to soar beyond. Look at our Parliament&mdash;a
      hurdy-gurdy turning out, age after age, a sing-song of pigmy regulations,
      accompanied for grum kettledrum by a musketry of suicides, and for pibroch
      by a European bleating of little children. We are still a million miles
      from civilization! For what is a civilized society? It can only be one in
      which the people are proud and happy! The people of Africa are happy, not
      proud; not civilized; the people of England have a certain pride, not a
      millionth part as superb as it might be, but are far from happy: far from
      civilized. The fact is, Man has never begun to live, but still sleeps a
      deep sleep. Well! let us do our best, we here! I have here a paper
      offering a prize to the man of us who will go to the root of our troubles,
      and my idea in usurping the place of our friend, Mr. Max, was to ask you
      to form an association with me to enter that competition. There is no
      reason why our association should not be large as the nation, nor why it
      should not spread to France and Turkey. For the thing presses, and
      to-morrow more of the slaughtered dead will be swarming in the mortuaries
      of London. Will you, then? The understanding will be this: that each man
      who writes his name in a note-book which will lie at Rose Cottage, Thring,
      or who sends his name, will devote sixty minutes each day to the problem.
      I happen to be in a position to use a chapel at Thring, and there I will
      hold a meeting&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Frankl rose: Thring was <i>his</i>, his own, own, own; and
      now his eyes had in them that catlike blaze which characterized his rages.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, police! police!&rdquo; he hissed low, &ldquo;what's the use of police that
      don't act!&rdquo; And now he raised his voice to a scream: &ldquo;Jews! Shew
      yourselves! Don't let this man stay here...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About twenty Jews leapt at the challenge; at the same time Hogarth, seeing
      two policemen running forward from the back, folded his arms, and cried
      out: &ldquo;Friends! I have not finished! Don't let me be removed...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon practically every man in the pit was in motion, for or against
      him, the galleries two oblongs of battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      As up the two curving stairs stormed the mob, by a sudden rush like an
      ocean-current he was borne off his feet toward the side, and was about to
      bring down his sharp-pointed little knuckles, when his eye fell upon the
      face of a lady who had fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had no idea that she was there!&mdash;Rebekah Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had quietly fainted, not at the rush&mdash;but before&mdash;during
      Hogarth's speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth managed to fight his way to a door at the platform back with her,
      entered a room where some chairs were, but, seeing a stair, could not let
      her go from his embrace, but descended, passed along a passage and out
      into a patch of green.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, under the dark sky, whispered: &ldquo;It is you&rdquo;, her forehead on his
      shoulder; and added: &ldquo;My carriage, I think, is yonder&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth saw the carriage-lights at the field's edge, bore her thither,
      laid her with care on the cushions, kissed her hand: and this act Frankl
      saw&mdash;with incredulity of his own eyes. As he approached, Hogarth
      walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl mastered his voice to say blandly in Spanish: &ldquo;Well, how did you
      get through, sweet child? Who was that man&mdash;? But stay: where are
      those two fools?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This meant the two familiars&mdash;the Arabs, Isaac and Mephibosheth, one
      of whom had come as footman, the other as coachman&mdash;and, as he went
      raging about the carriage, with stamps, his boot struck against a body.
      There was enough light to reveal to his peering that it was Mephibosheth,
      whom Isaac had stabbed, and fled...
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl lowered his ear&mdash;doubted whether he could detect a breathing;
      and though scared, he being a Cohen, and the presence of death defilement,
      yet he stayed, bending over Mephi several minutes, thinking, not of him,
      but of Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is that fool, Isaac, has done it&rdquo;, he thought; &ldquo;and if the man be dead&mdash;&rdquo;
       What then? &ldquo;<i>If</i> he be dead, I've got you, Mr. Hogarth, in the hollow
      of this hand....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His fingers passed over the body: there, sticking in the breast, was a
      cangiar which Isaac, in his panic, had left, and Frankl's hand rested on
      the handle; if he did not consciously press the knife home, very heavily
      his hand rested on it, eyes blazing, beard shaking....
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he drew out the knife carefully, to hide it in the carriage, listened
      again close, felt sure now that death was there, and now scuttled, as if
      from plague, guiltily hissing: &ldquo;Putrid dog...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he led his carriage to the station, and made a deposition of the
      murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Asked if he had any suspicion as to the culprit, he said: &ldquo;Not the least:
      I left the man alone with the carriage, and who could have had any motive
      for killing him beats me.&rdquo;

      VII. &mdash; THE ELM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hogarth, meantime, had made his way to the front of the room, then
      vomiting its throng, discovered Loveday, and, deciding to walk home, they
      were soon on the cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly Loveday: &ldquo;To-morrow will conclude my fifth week in Westring.
      What, do you suppose, has made me stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have wondered&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I work better here...Hogarth, you inspirit me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, yes. Merely your presence is for me a freshness and an enthusiasm:
      I catch in the turn of your body hints of adventurous Columbuses, Drakes,
      nimble Achilles; and sibylline meanings in some glance of yours infect my
      fancy with images of Moses, blind old Homers&mdash;prophet, lawgiver, poet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were passing along a stretch of sand, with some lights of Lowestoft
      in sight, arm in arm; and Hogarth said: &ldquo;Well, you speak some big words.
      But my life, you understand, has been as simple and small as possible. I
      will tell you: my father sent me to an extraordinary school&mdash;where he
      got the coin I could never find out&mdash;Lancing College at Shoreham.
      There I did very well&mdash;only that I was continually <i>getting</i> it!
      What was the matter with me when a boy I can't understand: I was the
      devil. One summer vacation (I was fourteen) I stole three pounds from the
      old man, and ran away one Sunday night. Passed through London and soon was
      apprentice in a blacksmith's shop in a Kent village called Bigham. But in
      six months I had the forge at my fingers' ends, and was off: nothing could
      hold me long. One day I turned up before the Recruiting Office of Marines
      in Bristol&mdash;just of the right age for what they call 'second-class
      boys'&mdash;and decided upon the sea&mdash;that sea there&mdash;which,
      from the moment I saw it at the age of four, caused me a swelling of the
      breast with which, to this day, it afflicts me. Well, I got the
      birth-certificate of another boy, scraped through, was entered into a
      District Ship, and finally sailed in the <i>St. Vincent</i> to the Pacific
      Station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However, my trial of His Majesty's ships was not a success: twice I was
      in irons, once leapt into mid-ocean; nor could the battleship hold me when
      she had nothing to teach me; so I did to the King what I had done to the
      old man&mdash;cut and ran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was at Valparaiso, and I made my way across the continent to Buenos
      Ayres.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I forget now what took me to Bristol: but there I was one day when I
      happened to see&mdash;what do you think?&mdash;a girl&mdash;sixteen&mdash;I
      a stripling of nineteen, or so&mdash;but she most precocious, spoke like a
      woman&mdash;a grating in a wall between us. Ah, well, God is good, and His
      Mercy endureth for ever. But she said it could never be&mdash;she a
      Jewess: though that, by the way, is nonsense, for she is a Jewess, and a
      Parisienne, and a Hindoo, and a Negress, and a Japanese, and the man who
      marries her will have a harem. My friend, I have seen her this very
      night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was silent. Suddenly he broke out: &ldquo;I came home raving! The old man was
      scared out of his wits by my frenzy&mdash;I drank like ten men&mdash;in a
      month was the terror of Westring. One midnight, going home through the
      beech-wood&mdash;I don't know if you have noticed a hollow elm-tree which
      stands to the right of the path?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have&rdquo;, said Loveday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall pass near it presently; and at the moment when we approach it, I
      shall feel a little thrill in my back: always it is so with me. But I was
      saying: that midnight, as I passed the tree, drunk as I was, I saw a naked
      black man with a long beard run out; I took to my heels; he was after me;
      till I reached the bridge, when I stopped, faced him, fired a blow into
      his eyes, and he vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the week I continued to see apparitions. My groans were heard in
      the farm-yard: Lord have mercy upon me! Christ have mercy upon me! I was
      visited by the Methodist preacher at Thring; and finally I found solace: I
      became a class-member, a leader, a local preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For some time I have been conscious of dissatisfaction among the people
      with my preaching, who say that my God 'is not a personal God', and that
      my Christianity is 'rum stuff': I am therefore meaning to give it up. But
      I still preach every second Thursday night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was about that time that, by accident, I found out the power of my
      hand to cure headache, and things like that, and the sensation among these
      villagers was enormous, I can tell you, six years ago; now they come to be
      touched without the slighest sense of the unusual. But what I have done
      well in was&mdash;the farming. I knew little of agriculture&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point they turned into the lane to Westring: and Loveday went with
      him a little beyond Priddlestone to see the fatal elm.

    <h2>
      VIII. &mdash; THE METEOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning, after breakfast, Hogarth went down old Thring Street,
      and spent a penny for a note-book to contain the signatures of his
      association.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was no day for interest in that scheme: for under the projecting
      first-floor of the paper-shop were newspaper placards bearing such words
      as:
    </p>
    <p>
      THE EARTH IN DANGER
    </p>
    <p>
      SHALL WE PERISH TO-NIGHT?
    </p>
    <p>
      and Hogarth was soon bending in the street over a paragraph, short&mdash;but
      in <i>pica</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Tissot, the astronomer, had, at half-past ten the previous night,
      observed through the 40-inch telescope of the Nice observatory a body
      which seemed a tiny planet or aerolite of abnormal size. It was sighted at
      a point two degrees W. of <i>a</i> Librae at an angle of 43 1/2° with the
      horizon, and had been photographed, its elements calculated, its spectrum
      taken. The ascertained diameter was 3° 17&rdquo;, or about 73 miles, and its
      substance seemed to consist of ironstone mixed with diamond.
    </p>
    <p>
      By noon a fresh light was thrown upon the little world, the Yerkes
      observatory and Greenwich both uttering their voice, the Astronomer Royal
      announcing that the so-called planet was merely a meteor&mdash;not more
      than 400 yards in diameter, with a low velocity of two miles a second; and
      its distance was less than a tenth of that estimated by Tissot. The Yerkes
      observatory fixed the diameter at 230 yards. All, however, agreed in the
      opinion that it must strike the earth between ten and twelve that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      These later announcements so much allayed the panic, that by one o'clock
      Hogarth, on peeping into the note-book on the box before the smithy, saw
      six signatures; and a young man who came about six P.M. to sign, cried
      out: &ldquo;Hullo! the book is filled up!&rdquo; on which Hogarth ran out, saying:
      &ldquo;Don't run away on that account, I'll run and get&mdash;&rdquo; darting into the
      house to ask Margaret where a certain account-book was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't I throw it into the box of rubbish in the cellar at Lagden, when
      we were leaving?&rdquo; she asked; on which he threw off his apron, and was off
      toward Lagden Dip to get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had almost cleared the village when he was blocked by a crowd before a
      cottage, from out of which were coming screams&mdash;a woman's; and he ran
      in, found a man named Fred Bates beating his wife, planted a blow on his
      chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the wife of Bates was found dead, greatly disfigured
      about the face, whereupon Bates was arrested, and Hogarth, as we shall
      see, was subpoenaed to give evidence of the beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten minutes he was at the old farm-house of the Hogarths.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new tenant was a Mr. Bond, a bankrupt metal-broker, who had two
      hobbies&mdash;farming and astronomy; and, as Hogarth approached the
      yard-gate, he saw Mr. Bond, his two daughters, his servants, grouped round
      an optic tube mounted on a tripod. He asked permission to get the
      account-book, got it, in a few minutes was again passing through, and, as
      he went by, bowing his thanks, Mr. Bond said: &ldquo;But&mdash;have you seen the
      asteroid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;whereabouts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite visible to the naked eye yet: but come&mdash;you shall see&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He himself looked through, fixing the sight, turning the adjuster; then
      with fussy suddenness: &ldquo;Now, sir&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth put an eager eye to the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see her?&rdquo; said Mr. Bond, rubbing his soft old palms; &ldquo;straight for us
      she comes&mdash;in a considerable hurry by this time, I can tell you! and
      if she happens to break up in the air, then, pray, sir, that a splinter of
      her may fall into your back yard&mdash;not too big a one! but a nice
      little comfortable <i>piece</i>&rdquo;&mdash;he rubbed his palms&mdash;&ldquo;for you
      know, no doubt, of what her substance is composed? Diamond, sir, in
      extraordinary evidence! in conjunction with specular iron ore, commonly
      called the red haematite, and the ferrous carbonate, or spathic iron. You
      see her, sir? you see her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth whispered: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, fairest among ten thousand, sailing the high seas she came; and
      longer than was modest he stopped there, gazing, then ran, wondering at
      her daisy loveliness, not dreaming that between himself and her was&mdash;a
      relation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke up with a European display soon after eleven that night over the
      North Sea.

    <h2>
      IX. &mdash; HOGARTH'S GUNS
    </h2>
    <p>
      At the moment when Hogarth was peering through the telescope, a man was
      loitering before his cottage&mdash;one of the Hall's park-keepers; and
      when Margaret put out her head to look for Richard's coming, the man
      whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment a note was in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;DEAR MISS HOGARTH,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is to ask you to be certain sure to meet me this evening at 9 P.M.
      on the towpath. It isn't to-day that you are well aware of the state of my
      feelings toward you: but it is not to talk sweethearting that I wish to
      see you now, but about your brother, and the matter is about as important
      as can be. If I were in your place, I should destroy this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours, with my respects,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BARUCH FRANKL&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret tore it up, and &ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;what is anyone to
      do? If I only had the money to make up those fifty pounds! May the Holy
      Spirit guide me now...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening she stole out, and met Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      He assumed a very respectful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Hogarth&rdquo;, said he at once, &ldquo;have you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have not been told that your brother has been to the Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in patience for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came&mdash;you couldn't believe&mdash;to beat me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard! I don't understand. When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday&rdquo;. (In reality it was four weeks before.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Revenge! Blind, murderous revenge for turning him neck and crop out of
      Lagden!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>are</i> in a temper! But I can't understand a word of it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is what I had to tell you. He came to my house&mdash;And how
      good have I been to this man! Didn't I send him the fifty pounds&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that <i>was</i> kind. But I must tell you, Mr. Frankl, that Richard
      knows nothing of the fifty pounds&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then it is <i>your</i> fault! Oh, he did not know of the fifty
      pounds? Then it is your fault entirely, this rage of his against me&mdash;He
      threatened to shoot me dead&mdash;thrice he threatened&mdash;soon, he said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Richard!&mdash;your nice Richard! But what did I want you for
      to-night? It was to let you see that I have it in my power to let your
      brother in for three months hard&mdash;not less. But you know, my dear,
      don't you, that I wouldn't do anything to give you pain? That is why, so
      far, I've taken no steps. But your brother must be unarmed. I can't have
      my life exposed, after his threats, and all&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unarmed....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I have it on good authority that your brother has guns. I must have
      those guns put into my own hands by you...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I couldn't! He would find out...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I must act, that's all. Or no&mdash;I give you another chance&mdash;tell
      him of the fifty pounds I sent&mdash;that may disarm him in another way&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was sure that this she would not now do, yet felt relieved when she
      cried out: &ldquo;I couldn't! Not now! Can't you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is nothing to be done, then. I must act, that's all&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't be <i>hard</i>! What can I do? Sooner or later he'd be sure to
      miss them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poh! he is not always shooting, I suppose? And after a few weeks I'd give
      them back. Anyway, think it over: and I'll be here on Tuesday night next
      at nine to receive them. Good night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked palely after him, her feet in a net, new to her, woven of
      concealments and deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven that night she was sitting in their diminutive parlour,&mdash;Hogarth
      at a table inscribing the association's names received by post that
      evening; and at last, bending low over her sewing, she said: &ldquo;Richard, is
      it true you have been to the Hall?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He started! &ldquo;Yes. Who told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her piercingly. &ldquo;<i>Answer!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard it&rdquo;, she said with a stubborn nod, quite pallid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned upon her a stare of displeasure; but in that second they heard a
      shouting down the village, ran to the front, and saw heaven all like
      cancer and cracked window-panes, for from a central plash of passion the
      shattered asteroid had shot long-lingering ribbons of lilac light over the
      bowl of the sky.

    <h2>
      X. &mdash; ISAAC
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the Tuesday was the inquest on the murdered Mephibosheth; ending in a
      verdict of wilful murder against some person unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same night at nine Frankl had Hogarth's two guns from Margaret on the
      towing-path, she now well inveigled into his net, and under his commands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;to meet me-here again on Thursday night, at 7.30&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will tell one why, I suppose!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you come you will hear. And don't let anything keep you away&mdash;not
      <i>anything</i>, mind&mdash;if you take my hint&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left him with her head hung, praying for deliverance, but consenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next (Wednesday) morning Frankl was in a high room of the Hall, in a
      corner of which cowered the Arab, Isaac, and he said in his strong bass in
      Arabic: &ldquo;Well, Isaac, well&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A groan broke from the obese heap of grief; down each side of his kefie
      streamed waves of trembling; on his square-cut beard of ritual flecks of
      foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isaac, why did you kill Mephibosheth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vigorously sputtered Isaac, spitting out the ill-omened words. He said:
      &ldquo;Your servant did not kill Mephibosheth&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there was an inquest to-day, the Court decided that you did, and
      has sentenced you to be hanged by the neck like a dog&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arab sprang up, his thick bluish under-lip shivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An eye for an eye&rdquo;, said Frankl solemnly: &ldquo;it is written in the Torah&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mercy</i> My father served your father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have remembered that: that is why I have saved you from hanging like a
      dog at the hands of these <i>Goyim</i> vermin: but, Isaac, you must die&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God of&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dare raise your voice! Blood for blood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mercy</i>!&mdash;I did not mean to kill&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blood for blood, you dog! Raise it, and I fell you! Raise it, and the
      noose sinks into your fat swine's-throat! Can't you understand?&mdash;you
      have been tracked by the avengers of blood! and you may swing lingeringly,
      with a crowd of Christian boys and girls mocking round you, or you may
      shoot yourself in one painless flash. Which shall it be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Isaac, again dropping a-heap, covered his face, without answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, said Frankl, walking away, &ldquo;I can't wait all day. The detectives
      are at this moment downstairs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the Arab leapt up, and, in a movement of great dignity, with an
      out-rush of both arms, rent his caftan from the top to its muslin girdle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will shoot myself&rdquo;, he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl took snuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same night he took his secretary's typewriter, and spelled out the
      following note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;SIR,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Permit me to ask you as an old friend of your father's if you are aware
      that your sister Margaret is the lover of the lord of the manor? Everybody
      seems to see it, but yourself. I have reason to know that the very day you
      receive this she will be meeting him at about 7.30 P.M. under the old elm
      in the beech-wood near the Hall-park.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;ONE WHO SHALL BE NAMELESS&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth received it by post the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to think, as he worked, of something to say at the service that
      night on the text: &ldquo;God's way is in the Sea&rdquo;, but the glare of forge and
      heated metal swam vaguely, a fog of red, about his consciousness. And
      mixed with those recurring words: &ldquo;the old elm&rdquo;, &ldquo;God's way&rdquo;, something
      with a voice shouted inside him&mdash;a name&mdash;<i>Margaret!</i> Anon
      his face flushed to a dusky turbulence, and he hurled the sledge high to
      shatter the earth, like Thor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he had the thought that he would clean his rifle, and, dropping a
      hot iron which vanished with a stifled cry into black water, he tossed his
      tongs clattering, and almost ran toward the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not, however, reached the back door when he heard his name called
      from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now happened to him the most momentous event of his life&mdash;though
      nothing could have seemed more commonplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an old fellow named Tom Bates who had called him&mdash;father to
      that Fred arrested for the murder of his wife&mdash;a Yarmouth fisher and
      herring-curer.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Hogarth twisted round, with that stare of his large and bloodshot
      eye, &ldquo;Here&rdquo;, said the old man, &ldquo;take them&rdquo;&mdash;holding out a basket of
      herrings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth seemed not to understand, but then said: &ldquo;All those for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every bloomin' one!&rdquo; answered Bates, with the dropped jaw of pantomime,
      and a far-away look of blue astonishment which he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is extremely handsome of you. Can you spare all that&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spare, <i>ya'as!</i> They're easy enough come by, for that matter. Why,
      the day's work of a fisherman gives him enough fish to live on all the
      week, and he could lie around idling the other six days, if he chose, only
      anybody can't live on nothing but fish &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, destined to produce a horror of great darkness, and a cup of
      trembling of which all the nations should drink, hardly affected Hogarth
      at the time. He <i>did</i>, indeed, shoot an interested glance at the old
      man, but the next moment his mind, numb that morning, was left dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;take them&mdash;they are yours&rdquo;, said Bates. &ldquo;But with regard
      to that God-forsaken son of mine: you'll be givin' evidence agen him, I'm
      told&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his sleeve wiped a tear, Hogarth promised to make his evidence mild,
      and was left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now his purpose of cleaning the rifle was turned: he went back to the
      forge, and worked till Margaret, at one o'clock, called: &ldquo;The dinner is on
      the table&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that table, for a long time, silence reigned, Margaret's eyes fixed on
      his face, his on his plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the end he said: &ldquo;Are you going to chapel to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her bosom heaved; she cleared her throat: she had to meet Frankl by the
      towing-path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think I shall...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Margaret!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have something to do&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something&rdquo;&mdash;with a stubborn nod, and pallor&mdash;&ldquo;if I tell you <i>something</i>
      that should be enough&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will go to chapel to-night&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shan't&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before seven they left the cottage together for the chapel,
      Hogarth taking his hunting-crop&mdash;from habit; he had also a little
      Bible; in his jacket, tight at the slight waist, unbuttoned at the breast,
      lay the anonymous letter, and a little poetry-book, neither moon nor star
      lighting the night, bleak winds swooping like the typhoon among the year's
      dead leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapel was a paltry place, though in the wall to the right of the
      preacher was a slab bearing the inscription:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                      ON THIS STONE
                  JOHN WESLEY PREACHED
                 IN THE VILLAGE, ON THE
                      9TH JULY 1768
</pre>
    <p>
      And they sang a hymn; Hogarth &ldquo;prayed&rdquo;; read a chapter; once more the
      harmonium mourned; Hogarth gave the text: &ldquo;God's way is in the sea...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even as he uttered it, he happened to glance toward the &ldquo;mission-pew&rdquo;&mdash;a
      square pew rather behind the pulpit: Margaret no longer there.
    </p>
    <p>
      A paleness as of very death&mdash;then a dreadful wrath reddened his dark
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized his hunting-crop; and, without a word, sped bent and thievish
      down the steps&mdash;and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Loveday in a middle pew, perceiving here something sinister,
      like a still wind flew to a back door, before ever the amazement of the
      people had given place to a flutter like leafage; and running fast, he
      came up with Hogarth by a stile twenty yards behind the chapel, touched
      his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the devil with you...!&rdquo; shouted Hogarth, running still, and there
      Loveday stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret, meantime, was hurrying toward the towing-path, while Richard, in
      a direction at right angles to hers, was pelting toward that spot terrible
      to him&mdash;the elm.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment when he entered the deep darkness of the beeches, he heard
      what sounded like a pistol-shot, rain now falling drop by drop, and
      through the forest with an uplifting whoop, like batsmen, swooped the
      tomboy winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, approaching the elm, again he felt that thrill which the spot had for
      him, and came peering, at slower pace: no sound but the gibbering rout of
      the stiff-stark beech-leaves. Some steps more, and now he was at the mound
      which surrounds the tree: stood, listened: silence, sightlessness:
      Margaret not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more forward step: and now his foot struck a body.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stooped, his hand touched a revolver&mdash;which was his own;
      another moment, and he saw running lanterns borne by two park-keepers, and
      by their light saw the body of Isaac, who but now had shot himself with
      the weapon that was in Hogarth's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The park-keepers had just been urged by their master to the spot, he
      having, he told them, heard a pistol-shot; and before anyone could speak
      Frankl himself was there, defiled with the presence of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked from Hogarth to the corpse, and from the corpse to Hogarth,
      then, snatching the weapon from Hogarth's hand, exclaimed: &ldquo;Why, bless my
      heart, you've <i>murdered</i> the man....&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XI. &mdash; WROXHAM BROAD
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a cottage in Thring Street, marked &ldquo;E. Norfolk, E. 58, Constabulary&rdquo;,
      Hogarth passed the night, having been arrested the moment he returned home
      from the elm.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterwards Margaret, who had found no Frankl at the
      towing-path, came home to the ghastliest amazement throughout Thring, so
      that sleep overcame the village only toward morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      At 7.30 A.M. Hogarth was marched to Beccles, then after an inquest-verdict
      appeared before the magistrates' court, and was committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the witnesses in the summary-jurisdiction court had been Loveday,
      who had deposed that Hogarth, on leaving the chapel, was, beyond doubt, in
      a passion; and mixed with the crowd was Margaret, who, standing thickly
      veiled, heard that evidence. And thought she: &ldquo;Is it possible that he can
      be giving evidence against Richard like that? And smiling, the mean, false
      thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had disappeared on the morning after the arrest: and Loveday was now
      racked by disquiet, wondering how she was living, though she and he were
      in the same train, unconscious of each other, when he followed Hogarth to
      Norwich; and, as Margaret stepped upon the Thorpe platform there, a Jew,
      who was watching the arrival of every train, spied and shadowed her to the
      old Maid's Head, this intricate city being now crowded, the Assizes all in
      the air, mixed with the Saturday cattle-market.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten the next morning Margaret learned at the Guildhall the address of
      her brother's defending solicitor, and set out to find him, the
      wretchedest woman on earth now.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as she passed by the archway in the tower of St. Peter Mancroft,
      Loveday stood before her; and she started like a shying horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo;&mdash;she went on past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took two steps after her. &ldquo;Are you in a hurry? Can I come with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite near. Thank you&mdash;I'd liefer go alone&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, a delicate being, all nerves, was repelled; lifted the old cloth hat;
      but then again stepped after her, saying: &ldquo;But are you angry with me for
      something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I be? I have no right to expect anything from you, Mr.
      Loveday&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No right? You <i>have</i>, a little, I fancy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said it at her ear with such a lowering of the eyelids, that it pierced
      to her fond heart, and she smiled with a &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; uncertain, half turned to
      him; but said: &ldquo;I must be getting on&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is most important that I should talk to you about everything.
      Where are you staying?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is some distance from here&rdquo;, she answered, undecided whether or not to
      give her address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;in that case&mdash;but still&mdash;will you meet me? Say here&mdash;this
      evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see if I can&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At seven?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will see&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they parted, she to tread that intricacy of streets round the Market,
      with stoppages for enquiries, till she found the office, where she
      presently sat in an inner room, veil at nose-tip, and before her at a
      grate stood Hogarth's solicitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, till now, for shame, she had concealed, she revealed: showing how
      Richard could not possibly have taken the revolver with him to the elm,
      since she, two days previously, had secretly given it to&mdash;someone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Carr, the solicitor, frowned, elaborating his nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is very extraordinary&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Whyever did you keep us in the
      dark as to all this before? And to whom was it that you gave the revolver?
      and why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I bound to tell that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you may be sure that the truth will be got from you. Stay&mdash;I
      must ask you to excuse me now. But tomorrow morning at this hour&mdash;will
      you? As for your brother, have no fears at all: he is now absolutely
      safe&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret went rapidly away, not knowing whither, only returning toward
      late afternoon to her inn. As she entered, a letter was handed her from
      Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Miss Hogarth:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only due to you that I should see you at once to explain the
      mystery of this affair, so as to clear your brother, and as it would not
      do for me to call upon you for obvious reasons, the only thing for us to
      do is to meet to-night on Mousehold Heath at 7 P.M. without fail...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What now was she to do? At &ldquo;7 P.M.&rdquo; she had half promised Loveday to meet
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what had her meetings with Baruch Frankl, innocent as they were,
      brought upon her and hers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Frankl <i>must</i> be kindly intentioned, she reasoned&mdash;since he
      had sent them the £50; and she thought of that agony of humiliation when
      she had asked Loveday for £2, and he had refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had given evidence against Richard with his down-turned smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had said a word at her ear&mdash;and her crushed heart had leapt.
      She did not know what to do, fell by her bedside and prayed to be taught
      which of the two was Richard's best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she passed over the inn-threshold, she decided in favour of Frankl: and
      a few minutes past seven was on Mousehold Heath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl hurried to meet her, and the hand which he held out was rather
      cold; but she did not take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Frankl&rdquo;, said she, &ldquo;before I give my hand, it is only what is due
      to me to hear how Richard's pistol, which I trusted to you, was found
      where it was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is only fair&rdquo;, answered Frankl; &ldquo;that is only fair. But I have
      a carriage there, let us get into it, and sit as we talk&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could see no carriage in that dark, yet it stood only some yards away&mdash;Frankl's
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I prefer to stand...&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As you like. But with regard to the gun, I should have thought that you
      could have guessed how it was&mdash;but no, you always mistrust me instead&mdash;the
      Jew. Don't you know that the dead man was a servant in my house? Well, I
      left the two guns in my study, and he, wanting to shoot himself, stole
      one, that's all&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was <i>he</i> shot himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who else? You don't suppose Richard shot him! You are as cool as
      they make them&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that was how it was! But couldn't you say that at the police-court&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am <i>going</i> to at the big trial, of course. But I was ill, am ill
      now, and here have I been running about all day on your brother's behalf,
      and dead tired&mdash;and ill, and all&mdash;and you won't let me have a
      rest in the carriage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as you put it in that way...&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they walked to a motor-brougham, sat within, and as they commenced to
      talk again, the brougham moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me&rdquo;, said Frankl, &ldquo;have you mentioned to anyone that you had given
      the guns to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told Richard's solicitor this morning&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was horribly imprudent, without consulting me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have been silent long enough, don't you? I didn't mention your
      name, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you didn't mention my name! That's all right, then! Look here, do you
      know&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you love me in your heart. Can't help yourself&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Frankl, do I look as if I was in the mood for that kind of fun
      to-night, a poor wretch like me, steeped in misery, my God knows&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> love <i>you</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suddenly grasped her wrist, his eyes blazing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop&mdash;let me get out of this&mdash;&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait!&mdash;I give you your chance!&mdash;Listen: I am not a man whose
      mind you can read right off like a book, I twist like an eel, I am deep, I
      am tricky, and I never yet met the man that I didn't hoodwink. Ninety-nine
      per cent of what I say is a lie; even when it is the truth, it is a lie just
      the same. But at this particular moment I am talking the God's truth: I
      want you! You shall be my little girl! Chuck Richard!&mdash;chuck the
      swine's-flesh!&mdash;I'll take you right away&mdash;to Paris&mdash;this
      very night&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had arisen, alarmed by his hissed fury. &ldquo;But, you are stark, staring,
      raving mad&rdquo;, she said proudly, &ldquo;that is what you are&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl struck the side of the brougham, it flew, and Margaret tottered
      backward with an exclamation. The next moment she sent forth a scream, the
      grip of Frankl on her wrist agonizing her bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; she cried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I gave you your chance!&rdquo; was Frankl's fierce answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me get out!&mdash;you must be a wretch&mdash;to take advantage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put his mouth to her ear till it touched. &ldquo;Your nice Richard flogged me
      like a dog! I felt the cuts to the marrow of my damned soul! Now I've got
      him in the hollow of this hand! Why, you helped me! you helped me! That's
      good! And I've got you, too&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blackness and swiftness bound her; a dizziness overcame her. Soon they
      were by a great pool of gloomy water&mdash;Wroxham Broad&mdash;where hern,
      wild duck, and the mast of the darkling boat brooded among bulrush; and
      now in three minutes more the brougham was sweeping over the lawn of a
      lonely building, surrounded by walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, peering, saw with joy both lights and a well-dressed man and woman;
      and, as the carriage stopped, she sprang out with alacrity, Frankl with
      her, still grasping her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir&rdquo;, she blurted out at once, &ldquo;you will help me, I know. I am a poor
      unfortunate woman&mdash;my name is Margaret Hogarth&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We know!&rdquo; said the gentleman, and, approaching Frankl's ear, asked in
      Yiddish: &ldquo;How long has she had her delusion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only about a week, I think. She may be violent at first, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Miss&mdash;Hogarth&rdquo;, said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Margaret passed the threshold; the doors closed upon her...

    <h2>
      XII. &mdash; THE ROSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the third morning of his confinement in Norwich, Hogarth was hurried
      into the hall of justice and the witness-box&mdash;in the dock Fred Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates had denied&mdash;with sufficient impudence, it seemed: for his wife
      had been found dead, battered and burned about the face, Bates' own hand
      also burned by the poker with which, <i>red-hot</i>, he was presumed to
      have beaten her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same afternoon Bates was sentenced to death: but, having had sunstroke
      in Egypt, was afterwards reprieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And two mornings later Hogarth heard the bar of the prisoner's dock clang
      behind himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech of leading counsel for the Crown was short: a letter, found on
      the prisoner, would be produced, in which some busybody had falsely
      informed the prisoner that Mr. Frankl would meet his sister under a
      certain elm-tree: and the prisoner, in a crisis of passion, had hurried
      from the pulpit to that tree, on observing that his sister had left the
      chapel (to keep a real appointment with Mr. Frankl elsewhere). Under that
      tree the prisoner had encountered the murdered man, whose Oriental dress
      on a dark night would give him a resemblance to Mr. Frankl, himself a Jew.
      The prisoner had then shot the deceased, mistaking him for Mr. Frankl, and
      had been found holding the smoking weapon, which he admitted to be his
      own. It was a painful case; but the chain of inference was not assailable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not assailable&rdquo; found an echo in the minds of solicitor and counsel for
      Hogarth, who with growing anxiety were awaiting the coming of Margaret
      with her story of the weapons. Margaret was where her name was changed to
      Rachel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now was the régime of examining counsel for the prosecution. The usher
      called: &ldquo;Baruch Frankl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice in the gallery shouted: &ldquo;Caps and tassels!&rdquo; while Frankl, in the
      witness box, bowed largely to both bench and bar. He put his palms on the
      red-hot rail, caught them up, put them again, caught up, put them; and
      still he bowed, while a trembling of the chin gave to his beard a downward
      waving.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now explain to the court the reasons for the state of the prisoner's
      feelings toward you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For one thing I had turned him out, because he could not pay his rent;
      for another, his sister was inclined, my lord, to be a little bit weak on
      my account&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little bit <i>what</i>?&rdquo; asked his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little bit weak, my lord&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>reciprocal</i> weakness?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my lord, you know the world&mdash;so do the gentlemen of the jury&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And of the Jewry!&rdquo; screamed his lordship, amid laughter from the merry
      wigs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Frankl stepped down, a name was called at which Hogarth went cold as a
      ghost: &ldquo;Rebekah Frankl&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in she stepped splendent, to stand like a Nubian woman, with that
      retreat of the hips, her ears torn with their load of gold, her throat and
      breast ablaze, she bringing into that English court the gaudy heat of the
      Orient, Baal and Astarté, orgies of Hindoo women in temples of Parvati,
      the pallid passion of Bacchantes. Though not tall, she was lofty, and her
      ebon eyes had that very royalty of the stare of the bent form in the dock,
      whose heart throbbed quick like paddle-wheels that thrash the sea, she his
      wild divinity, wild wife of his wild youth....
    </p>
    <p>
      At her shocking beauty the Court stood hushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She suggested the East: but in her speech was the energy of the West&mdash;sharp&mdash;a
      bass almost like her father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You recognize the prisoner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were present on the day of the 11th November when the prisoner
      entered your father's house, and attempted to strike him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did strike him&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he seem in a passion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seemed severe&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Severe! But was he not highly excited?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not seem so. Frowned and flogged&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whom was he ejected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Went of his own accord&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;try to remember. What made him go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He suddenly saw <i>me</i>, and fled&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughter droned through the court, in which she naïvely joined, while
      Hogarth's eyes and hers met one instant, blazed outrageously, and
      dropped....
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all. Counsel bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day grew toward evening, and still the stuffy Court sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Margaret Hogarth did not come; a defending counsel finished
      examination, counsel on the other side again addressed the Court, and
      again defending counsel. The judge then held the scales, the jury trooped
      away, the crowd buzzed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light in the room seemed to brood to a denser yellow, and anon to grow
      dim; the stuffed court festered; voices spoke, but low. The King of
      Terrors was here.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the jury came, the judge was called, Hogarth stood up, and the clerk
      of arraigns put a question to the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman said: &ldquo;We find the prisoner guilty: but beg to recommend him
      to the mercy of the Crown&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On what grounds?&rdquo; asked his lordship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the grounds of past good conduct and strong provocation&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge then placed on his head a square of velvet and passed the
      sentence of the Court.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the reign of stillness that followed, while the court clock's
      ticking was still loud, something which was thrown struck Hogarth on the
      arm, a red rose, black at heart, that had lain on the breast of Rebekah,
      who, when Hogarth looked round at her, was calmly drawing her mass of
      cloak about her throat.

    <h2>
      XIII. &mdash; OUT OF THE WORLD
    </h2>
    <p>
      A week later a governor and a chaplain together entered Hogarth's cell
      with news of his reprieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eight months later he was being trundled in &ldquo;Black Maria&rdquo; to Paddington
      Station amid a Babel of escaped tongues, when, sitting in his pigeonhole,
      he heard the unknown voice before him cry: &ldquo;Well, Jim, we're away to the
      mountain's brow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jim, nothing but a voice, was heard: &ldquo;Worse luck! I knows Colmoor, and I
      knows the Scrubs, and I knows Portland; and of the five I say&mdash;give
      me Jedwood. Who's the guy in front o' you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, you in front there, who <i>are</i> yer?&rdquo; cried the first, pounding.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered by a deep voice, which said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I AM WHO I AM&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, keep yer 'air on, if you've any left! It's the Lawd Chief
      Justice, mate! 'E says 'e's 'oo 'e are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Old on! <i>I</i> knows who it is: it's that new-comer, 33. They say he
      was once a priest&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now speech was swallowed up in hubbub, as the van ran battering down a
      rough street near the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then again Hogarth was whirled into night and space, and, toward morning,
      after the bumping climb of a van, was bidden to alight on moorland, where
      he spied, far off, set on a hill, a mighty palace of Romance, all grim,
      aloof, which was Colmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning while the outdoor gangs were being searched on parade
      before the exit, Hogarth saw a face which he knew; and &ldquo;You, Bates&rdquo;, he
      said, &ldquo;I thought you were in Eternity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no: there stood Bates, all capped and arrowed, cropped and neat, not
      wearing the filthy old scarf of liberty any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbor of Hogarth now was a stout man, with black hair, and grey
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He it was who had been&mdash;a priest: and in &ldquo;Black Maria&rdquo; had given that
      answer: &ldquo;I am who I am&rdquo;.

    <h2>
      XIV. &mdash; THE PRIEST
    </h2>
    <p>
      A year passed, during which John Loveday exhausted the resources of
      civilization, (1)in seeking Margaret, and (2)in investigating the
      innocence of Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, however, a sprightly, adventurous nerve in the mind, and would
      pull his velvet sleeves busily up&mdash;such was his little way. He began
      to plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the same time the ex-priest, in that far-off world of Colmoor, said
      one day to Hogarth: &ldquo;<i>You</i> won't be here long!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You jest,&rdquo; Hogarth answered; &ldquo;if I had the chance of escape, I should
      never take it. I am here by due legal process&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, if I say that you will escape, it is not because I am a prophet, but
      a man of the world, and know what happens in it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Converse with this deep, world-wise, and fluent man had now become to
      Hogarth like manna, or rather a vice, like opium: for in those grey eyes
      of the cleric was hinted anon the baleful glint of the cobra's.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day, a Saturday, outdoor gangs were recalled early, to &ldquo;clean up&rdquo; for
      Sunday, and out across the heath rang the great bell, Colmoor being famous
      for its bell, its tone and great size, larger than even the eight-ton
      &ldquo;Mighty Tom&rdquo; of Christ Church, for though its thickness was only six
      inches, it weighed, bell and clapper, ten tons, and was seven feet high
      and seven in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      A busy Saturday afternoon ensued, and whatsoever Hogarth's hand found to
      do he did it with his might, though his face now seemed all eyes&mdash;brown,
      bloodshot, imperially large, morbidly staring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was giving the finishing touches of order to his wooden spoon and
      salt-cellar, his tin knife, plate, and pint cup for gruel, when a Warder
      Jennings peeped in with, &ldquo;No. 76&mdash;you are to follow the assistant
      warder at once&rdquo;, and Hogarth descended to an ante-room where an official
      handed him a letter, which had been read and initialed by governor and
      chaplain.
    </p>
    <p>
      An event!&mdash;a letter in Colmoor, like a shark's fin on the voyages of
      old sailing ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was from Loveday, and concluded with a reference to Hogarth's &ldquo;poor old
      grandmother&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hogarth, who had no &ldquo;grandmother&rdquo;, propped his forehead to ponder that
      thing; and presently said: &ldquo;Oh, it is a cypher&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And by noting little peculiarities in the shapes of the letters, a double
      cross to a t, a q like a g, etc., he soon had &ldquo;flemecops-leftquary&rdquo;&mdash;which
      he took to mean: &ldquo;flee to me in the copse to the left of the quarry&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled with tenderness at the dear heart planning and daring so very
      much for him. But in his smile was a touch of disdain also, he not
      intending to &ldquo;flee&rdquo;.

    <h2>
      XV. &mdash; MONSIGNOR
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hogarth's first thought, as getting-up bell clattered réveille through the
      gallery, was of Loveday's cypher, and by the time the warder came to ask
      if he would see governor or doctor, a thought of Monsignor O'Hara had
      somehow mixed itself with the thought of the cypher; when an orderly
      handed in the day's brown loaf, he was thinking, &ldquo;Strange that he never
      told me what he has done&rdquo;; eating his pint of gruel, he thought: &ldquo;If I
      will not escape myself, I might perhaps let another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said O'Hara on the march out, &ldquo;you still here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where should I be?&rdquo; answered Hogarth, dull and sullen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where palaces stand open for you, and bank-notes&mdash;have you ever
      realized something very charming in the Helen pallor of a bank-note,
      Hogarth? And gold-yellow, sparkling gold! Hogarth, I&mdash;<i>love</i>
      gold! It is a confession&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it that love which brought you here?&rdquo; Hogarth asked with his sideward
      stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the priest turned a cold gaze upon him&mdash;had regarded
      Hogarth as a well-bred man, or would hardly have conversed with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a motive for asking&rdquo;, said Hogarth, eyeing the face of the prelate&mdash;a
      man of very coarse feature; a small head, made to receive the tonsure,
      with a low brow; a stern bottom lip, and long upper; a fat neck held
      majestically erect; and up stuck his double chin. In profile, the part
      between the sharp edge of the bottom lip and the chin-tip was divided,
      down near the chin tip, by an angle and crease; and the lower face seemed
      too massive for the size of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more exquisite than the contrast between his air of
      force, authority and importance, and the knickerbockers, the coarse cap,
      the canvas slop-jacket, which he wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly calm, he was yet very excited by that &ldquo;I had a motive&rdquo;; he said
      to himself: &ldquo;Suppose this man has some plan! He could invent ten, if he
      only knew it. And suppose he would tell me it, if I make him believe me
      innocent! It would be like him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the eleven o'clock dinner-bell rang, and they two were again
      together, O'Hara said: &ldquo;Hogarth, I have for some time been intending to
      give you my story. Have I in your eyes the air of a guilty man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; answered Hogarth, with a shrug; &ldquo;you talk nicely, and you
      know much&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much for the hollowness of friendship!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be sentimental&rdquo;, said Hogarth: &ldquo;I never pretended to be any friend
      of yours; but I do respect your talents, do pity your misery: and if I
      knew the solid facts of, as you have said, your 'innocence', I might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i>?&rdquo; whispered O'Hara with a thievish, fierce glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Help you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>In God's truth?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara said: &ldquo;I don't find it so cold as it was this morning. You must
      have observed a certain peculiarity of moorland climates&mdash;the same
      being true of the Roman Campagna, and of Irish peat-lands&mdash;that they
      are colder than elsewhere in the absence of the sun, and warmer in its
      presence. This afternoon&mdash;<i>I will tell you</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the great gates, and were marched to parade-ground for
      the second of the four daily searches; then, after three ounces of fat
      mutton and forty minutes' rest, the third search, the second march-out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And immediately beyond the gates O'Hara began: &ldquo;In order to paint you my
      life, Hogarth, I must give you at once to understand what has been its
      mainspring and secret: my passion for my Church&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, while his lips moved in prayer, and he crossed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From boyhood my dream was to see my Church supreme in the warfare of the
      world, I being a King's College and Maynooth man, at twenty-three was
      Senior Chancellor's Medallist, and seven years later, sent to Rome was
      quickly received into the Vatican household. It was recognized that I had
      a future: both gifts and graces; piety; a versatile tongue; a powerful
      voice; some learning; could dine, I could look august; above all, I knew
      my man and could talk him over. My great day came when, one morning, in
      St. Gregory the Great on Mount Coelius, I was consecrated Bishop Coadjutor
      to his Eminence the Archbishop of Westminster. Now I was on the heights.
      My life during the next ten years was a life of bustling action&mdash;and
      was led always with one unselfish object. No man ever spoke a greater
      number of words than I, Hogarth. I have breakfasted with the Prime
      Minister, lunched with a President of the Conference, and dined with the
      Bishop of London: between the three meals I have written a hundred letters
      and pitched into ten cabs. Such a life is very exhilarating, in
      comparison, for example, with quarrying. Oh, my God what am I fallen! Most
      of that time I was running over Europe: from Madrid to Vienna, from Rouen
      to Rome. It happened that the Archbishop of Paris was organizing a scheme
      of Church-workhouses in France, in the absence of municipal ones, such as
      we have here.... Well, it was a grand thing, but was falling through for
      lack of funds: so I, on my way to Rome, undertook the mission to plead the
      cause before his Holiness, and succeeded to this extent that, on my
      return, I had with me a casket from the good old man containing seven
      diamonds, which I might either dispose of personally, or hand over to the
      Paris fund. Now, it was during my stay at Rome that that series of events,
      culminating in the Jewish exodus from Europe, occurred; and on my journey
      home I was seized with the mighty thought that, since many of the Jews
      were perishing of want, <i>that</i> was the moment to reach their spirit
      through the body, and add their race to the trophies of the Church. Was it
      not a thought? You yourself, who are a Jew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth's eyes opened in surprise.&ldquo;<i>I</i> am not a Jew &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No? I should have said that there was a hint of expression somewhere&mdash;But
      to resume. I retained those seven diamonds, and disposed of them&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Honest behaviour!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perfectly honest! I acquainted the Pope&mdash;he sanctioned it! And now,
      I, single-handed almost, threw myself into that task. I hired, I built, I
      begged, I borrowed, I formed committees, I haunted Religious Houses, I
      sweated, I ran, I wept, I visited dens, I smoked opium, I drank gin, I
      framed memorials, I learned Yiddish, I read the Mishna and Gemara, I
      interviewed Rabbonim, I wrote tracts: I was busy. In the midst of it, I
      had to visit Rome ceremoniously, to assist at an interview between the
      Duke of York and his Holiness&mdash;arrived on the Monday, and on the
      Wednesday, I remember, attended a Court Ball in the suite of his Royal
      Highness. That night, when I returned to the Vatican, I found all the
      Piazza di San Pietro crowded. I do not know if you were free at the time
      when my friend, M. Tissot, startled everybody by predicting the collision
      of an asteroid with the earth? Tut, the silly being&mdash;he should have
      known from the body's response to the spectroscope that its condition was
      too friable to resist our atmosphere. But I never yet knew an astronomer
      not imbued with sensationalism they acquire a certain megalomania from
      their intercourse with space. But, at all events, the people, dreading the
      destruction of everything, had crowded toward the Vatican. The Duke of
      Genoa, I, and some of the College of Cardinals, stood watching from a
      balcony; and very imposing, I remember, was the moment when a glare
      appeared&mdash;I must stop&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were at the face of the rock, and the &ldquo;halt&rdquo; and &ldquo;set to work&rdquo; parted
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But again on the final march back at 5.15 when nightshades were falling
      fast like snow, and the arm now felt the pick a load, O'Hara began his
      muttering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was telling you about the asteroid&rdquo;, he said. &ldquo;Now this body, it was
      given out, contained diamonds in large evidence, and the mere thought of
      such a thing bursting in mid-air, and scattering itself about was, I&mdash;I
      confess, a little fascinating to my mind. A man might let his soul gloat
      upon such a hope till he went lunatic with lust! I&mdash;I confess, the
      thought was alluring to me. Diamond, my son: lucid&mdash;But when the body
      burst, and none of it came my way, I drove it from my mind: in fact, I
      never heard of a trace of it having been seen&mdash;hissed itself into
      gases in mid-air. Except in one instance&mdash;one instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I reached Calais on my homeward way, stopped there a day, awaiting
      the coming of Rouen, for whom I had nuncio communications, and in the
      evening went to visit a cottage where I had once been a great favourite
      with an old fellow called Santé-you know those Calais fishers, with
      painted sabots, and ochred trousers. And 'What!' said I to Santé, 'the
      nets already spread at this hour?' 'Nothing to be done to-day, my Father',
      he answered, and explained that he had attempted to pick up a stone before
      his door, and&mdash;it had burned him: he showed it me: it had the
      appearance of a piece of ferruginous rock, stuck with pieces of dirty
      glass; and it had burned Santé on the midnight of the asteroid's
      scattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine my excitement: 'The asteroid', I thought, 'may add fifty thousand
      Jews to the Church'. I asked Santé for the stone&mdash;Do you blame me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That day two months I had the diamonds lying polished in a casket in my
      house. My evil destiny, Hogarth, ordained that the casket was the one
      given me for Paris by the Pope, the number of the new diamonds the same&mdash;seven:
      and one day, about that time, the Vatican organ, the <i>Osservatore Romano</i>,
      published a dreadful article, hinting that I had applied to my own
      purposes seven diamonds entrusted me for Paris: the Pope, just dead, must
      have left some record of his gift. My friend, before I had heard a whisper
      of the attack upon me, the casket, whose lid was mosaicked with the Papal
      fanon, was secretly searched by a secretary in my house: the seven
      diamonds were seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Imagine the horror of what followed: I was abandoned by all&mdash;superior
      and inferior; the story of the meteor was received with sneers. The
      scandal reached the public papers&mdash;the public prosecutor. And here
      now is the wretch, Patrick O'Hara.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of this narrative was fiction! The Pope's diamonds O'Hara
      had duly handed to the Archbishop! and though there was such a man as
      Santé, no asteroid had ever fallen at his door. In fact, O'Hara was
      &ldquo;serving time&rdquo; for an assault upon a lady in a railway compartment between
      Whitchurch and Salisbury.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hogarth spent that night in meditating the pros and cons as to
      O'Hara's escaping; and, in a moment of destiny, said at last: &ldquo;If he is
      undeservedly doomed&mdash;&rdquo; and swooned to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very next day was foggy....
    </p>
    <p>
      On the march out O'Hara said: &ldquo;Here is something like a fog. On the
      Carinthian Alps, where you have dense woolly fogs, there is a race of
      goats, which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to escape?&rdquo; whispered Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth&mdash;! My God&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A trembling seized the priest's leathery left cheek, he at that instant
      seeing a vision of the world&mdash;Andalusian wines, hued ices, the
      opera-house, and great greyhounds of the sea, and a snuff which his gross
      nose loved at Gorey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth, you are not mocking me?&rdquo; chattered the priest's jaws, hurrying
      like a jarred spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am quite serious. You will have to run for it though&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Run!</i> I am not such a young man! Have pity Hogarth&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! Be a man&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest approached his mouth to Hogarth's ear: &ldquo;<i>I should die of
      fright!</i> My heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would it matter? I thought you had more beans&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But have you&mdash;a plan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. You must run to the copse&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be shot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>could</i> not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, do not&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, boy! Tell me, Hogarth...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Within the copse to the left of the quarry there is almost certainly at
      this moment waiting a man who, as soon as you pronounce my name, will help
      you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say <i>almost</i> certainly&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see him, O'Hara. But I should say he is there on a morning like
      this&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>What</i> a risk! <i>What</i> a risk!&rdquo; went the priest with lifted
      eyelids each time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cannot escape from prison without risk. But I, personally, would
      venture upon ten times as much, if I thought it becoming. There is,
      however, another risk: that you may not strike the part of the copse where
      he is. But near the 1 middle it is high&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, it is nothing but risks!&rdquo; whined O'Hara with opening arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not bound to try it. By the way&mdash;can you swim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I suppose so&mdash;yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then lift yourself to it, and risk it. I should, if I were you. Think of
      liberty, activity. Prick your spirit, grip at it, and spring it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I shall be shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! It does not matter! Crush your doubts, martyr yourself to your aim,
      and your aim will give you the crown of martyrdom&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;God reward you&mdash;I will think of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Do</i> it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In that case, don't trust to your own eyes&mdash;<i>I</i> will give you
      the signal with my handkerchief&mdash;so: you keep your eyes fixed on me.
      Then run, zigzagging. And tell Loveday for me to look after you, and not
      make any more plans for me. Good-bye, O'Hara! All this is very unselfish
      of me, for I lose my old talky-talky O'Hara&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted at the rock, and set to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As minutes, half-hours passed, the condition of O'Hara became piteous,
      hideous. His knees knocked together. Like death he dreaded, like life
      awaited, that signal. He said to himself: &ldquo;This Hogarth will be my
      ruin...God deal not with me after my sins...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth was waiting that the warders' morning watchfulness might yield to
      the influence of use and time; but near nine, when the morning fog showed
      signs of thinning, he approached the water-can to ask for a drink, O'Hara
      being then two yards from him, wheeling a barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he stooped to the water, his huge stare ranged the moor, took in the
      truth of it, and, after waiting ten, fifteen seconds, he upset the can. As
      two officers, at the outcry, ran toward the spot, Hogarth, his eyes fixed
      upon them, waited&mdash;and all at once, with a flourish, drew his
      handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara, with a heavy but impassioned run, was away...
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not run five yards when a chorus of whistles was shrilling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And quick, that monotony reels into a very frenzy of sensation: it is no
      more the same world, the same men. Lo, in the Palace of Continuity is an
      Event.
    </p>
    <p>
      33 was off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five hundred pairs of eyes lit up, and the flurried warders ran in random
      dismay to see to it! How if all the five hundred should do the like,
      simultaneously?&mdash;a possibility underlying, through all its breadth,
      the little social &ldquo;system&rdquo; which has produced Colmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the five hundred, exhorted, stamped at, shouted at, remained quiet,
      though restive, only the wild eye showing the wild thought, while two of
      the warders pursued O'Hara who had also to run the blockade of two pickets
      of the civil guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The escaping convict, however, has this advantage: that his mind is strung
      to a far higher pitch than his pursuers'; and, given a certain ecstasy,
      everything can be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      So O'Hara separately dodged the two pickets, and was making bolt for the
      copse before three rifles, aimed at a large vague ghost, rang out, and did
      not hit. He plunged madly into the brambly bush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately a bleating like a child's trumpet was heard from its midst;
      and in a few seconds, not one, but <i>four</i>, men were seen to rush
      toward the river, all in convict knickerbockers, stockings, caps, all in
      black overcoats: and one carried a bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the river one was shot in the leg&mdash;a black sailor, who, with
      two roughs, had undertaken the risk for lucre. The rest escaped.

    <h2>
      XVI. &mdash; THE ROPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Soon after this Hogarth was taken with vomitings, his heart retching at
      Colmoor. His dark cheeks jaundiced; those mobile nostrils of his small
      bony nose yawned, like an exhausted horse's; his face was all a light of
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether or not some suspicion of his complicity with O'Hara had occurred
      to the authorities, he now found himself transferred to another &ldquo;graft&rdquo;:
      from quarrying was set to trenching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four things are inexhaustible in the earth: the hope of a gambler; the
      sea; the lip of a lover; and the capacity of Colmoor to be trenched and
      quarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in Hogarth's new gang was&mdash;Fred Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Hogarth, intent upon his work, heard a sob and, glancing, saw
      that Bates had dropped his spade and buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Fred, not giving in?&rdquo; He went quickly and pressed his palm on
      Bates' brow, saying: &ldquo;Patience! Stiffen your back: look how <i>I</i> slip
      into it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Hogarth, you don't know. I am an innocent man&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So am I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but <i>I</i> was certain in my own mind to be out within anyway, six
      months; <i>you</i> wasn't. That makes a difference, don't it? That touches
      the nerve, don't it? Ah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did you expect to be out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had a brother-Bob-in the 9th Lancers in Punjab and his regiment was
      ordered home just a week before I was arrested. Well, the morning after
      the missus was killed, I went early&mdash;for I knew I'd soon be arrested&mdash;to
      a stableman at Beccles&mdash;you know old Harris&mdash;and I made him
      swear to give a letter to Bob the moment Bob put foot in Southampton, and
      to nobody else. In the letter I told Bob where he was to look for
      so-and-so, and how he was to prove my innocence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I don't understand a word of what you are saying&rdquo;, interrupted
      Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you. I did not kill my Kit. The burn on her face, and on my
      hand, wasn't any red-hot poker. Did you ever hear such bosh? Look here,
      you mind, don't you, the talk that week about the world getting blowed up
      by some comet? Well, about 3 P.M. on the comet day, as I was walking home
      through Lagden Dip, an old gent, the same as took the farm over after you,
      he comes up to me, and he says: 'If you should happen to see anywhere in
      your travels', sez 'e, laughin' and rubbin' his hands, 'a piece of hot
      iron after eleven to-night, you bring it to me, and I'll put a cheque for
      One Thousand Pounds there in the middle of your palm'. Well&mdash;I said
      it was a Wednesday, didn't I? And Wednesday bein' the pay-day on the
      Eastern, me and the missus had a drop o' beer that afternoon, and you know
      'ow you come and catched me a-paying of her&mdash;dirty dog that I was
      those days. But, Hogarth, you hadn't hardly gone when we made it up
      between us, and the rest of that evening we was just like&mdash;well&mdash;two
      bloomin', cooin' doves! kissin', blubblin', havin' drinks, and doin' our
      week's shoppin' together. Well&mdash;stop, here's Black&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were interrupted, and for two days found no other chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days during which Hogarth received another letter from Loveday, of
      which one paragraph was as follows: &ldquo;The fifteen pounds which you left in
      Lloyd's Bank I have managed to withdraw for you on the authority of your
      aunt, Miss Sarah Hogarth&rdquo;, and at once he scented a cypher, having no
      fifteen pounds, and no aunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had unravelled it as before, he had: &ldquo;Why you failed? Expect&mdash;Balloon&mdash;Rope&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was astounded: and could only conclude that O'Hara had not delivered
      his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the image of O'Hara had mixed itself with his thoughts of the
      copse, so now the image of Fred Bates mixed itself with the balloon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was partly through <i>his</i> evidence that Bates was here...!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third day Bates, as though he had just left off, resumed his story:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Seely's, the general shop, at Priddlestone&rdquo;, said he; &ldquo;it was
      there we always did our Wednesday-night marketin'&mdash;nobody would
      believe what high old jinks those Wednesday pay-days was to us Great
      Eastern blokes! By the time we reached Priddlestone, we had a quart of
      four-ale down us, let alone what we'd had before, and, as the saying is,
      one glass leads to another. By now we was feeling just nicely, thank you,
      and instead of going to Seely's, we took a short cut to 'The Broom', and
      it was going on for past eleven when we found ourselves in&mdash;you know
      the beechwood between Priddlestone and Thring&mdash;she singing all the
      time with her head thrown back, at the top of her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth, it gives me the creeps to think of! Suddenly it looked as if the
      whole wood was lit up: there was the sky all cut up with streamers, I saw
      my Kit quite plain, then all at once there was a whishin' and a rushin'
      among the trees, like steam&mdash;and I saw my Kit drop smack. In two
      ticks my head was sober: but, as I ran to her, I staggered sideways upon
      my left hand, and I let such a <i>yell</i> out of me&mdash;had put my hand
      upon something flamin' hot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minute I bent over my old woman I knew she was a deader; and I
      dropped down, and I called of her, and I shook of her, and it was quite
      two hours before I come to myself properly, by which time the affair what
      struck her down was gone out in darkness. Of course, the first thing I
      thought of was the old gent at Lagden. 'This should mean a cool thou',
      says I to myself. But I knew I should be arrested first thing in the
      morning, except I told plain out what had happened: and that, you bet, I
      didn't mean to do, for if once I mentioned that there piece of iron before
      I had it safe off the lord-o'-the-manor's land, I knew it 'ud be taken
      from me. But to take it off before another day or two was out of the
      question&mdash;it was too hot. So says I to myself: 'I'll <i>get</i>
      convicted; and to-night I'll write a letter to Bob, telling him where to
      find the affair, how to get the thou, and <i>after</i> he's got it, how to
      set about gettin' the case retried '.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so said, so done. You know that old elm in the beech-wood? I dug a
      grave at the foot of it, and managed to kick and roll the affair into the
      grave, then I took up my Kit, carried her home, and by the time I pegged
      out the letter to Bob, I saw day breakin'. So I made paces for Beccles,
      knocked up old Harris, and gave him the letter for Bob. By eight o'clock I
      was arrested&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the 5.15 recall-bell rang out, and there was falling into
      line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next time that they had speech together, Hogarth said: &ldquo;And were you
      such a clown, Fred Bates, as to imperil your life for a paltry thousand
      pounds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Paltry</i> thousand pounds?&rdquo; answered Bates, surprised: &ldquo;Hark at this!
      Didn't I peril my life ten times more in Egypt for a bob a day? I tell you
      I was certain in my own mind of getting out in a few weeks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what happened to prevent you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this: Bob died on the troop-ship coming home; that's all&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you could write old Harris to open your letter to Bob, and act on it,
      or else hand it over to your father&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word, but haven't I wrote? Old 'Arris is either dead and buried, or
      gorn away, or somethin'. I've waited a year and nine months&mdash;good
      God! and no answer yet&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Fred! I could weep blood for you. Believe in God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More Devil than God about Colmoor, it strikes me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As though <i>you</i> knew! Suppose I strike you blind&mdash;<i>now</i>&mdash;with
      a flash of Him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't take your meaning, sir&rdquo;, said Bates, with a strange heart-bound
      and sense of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember 33 of the quarry-gang, Fred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth whispered: &ldquo;It was <i>I</i> who got him off&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates whitened to the lips. &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought as much&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is yet another chance, which <i>you</i>, if you like, may take&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bates saw heaven opening; but with this vague hope was left two days.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third, Hogarth explained what he assumed to be the new plan of
      Loveday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I take it&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;that he will pass over the moor in a balloon
      trailing a rope, which will have a loop to be slipped under the arms. I
      tell you, there are dangers in this scheme: you may be shot. Are you for
      trying it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trying it, aye&rdquo;, said Bates, with fifty times the boldness of O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now began for these two a painfulness of waiting days, the sleep of
      both, meanwhile, being one nightmare of confused affrights, balloons and
      deliriums.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten times they re-discussed every possibility of the scheme, Hogarth
      giving messages for Loveday, heaping counsels upon Bates. Nothing remained
      to be said, and still the days passed over the time-worn hearts, till a
      month went by.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last something was observed in the sky&mdash;afar to the N.W.&mdash;in
      the afternoon turn, about two o'clock, a mist on the moor, but the sky
      almost cloudless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon Hogarth, who first saw the object, stepped, as if looking for
      something, close to Bates, hissing: &ldquo;<i>Goodbye!</i> Keep cool&mdash;choose
      well&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bates shovelled on steadily, as though this was a day like others; but
      twice his knees gave and bent beneath him; and there was a twitching of
      the livid under-lip, piteous to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      It drew nearer, that silent needle, while Bates worked, delving,
      barrowing, making little trips; plenty of time; and no one noted his lip
      which pulled and twitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without visible motion it came, wafted on the breaths of high heaven: half
      an hour&mdash;and still it was remote, fifteen hundred feet up. Bates and
      Hogarth peered to see a rope, but could none.
    </p>
    <p>
      After fifty minutes it was actually over the moor, all now conscious of
      it; but the rope was indistinguishable from the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was there, walking the ground, at its end a horizontal
      staff....Hogarth, with wiser forethought than Loveday's, had predicted,
      not a staff, but a loop.
    </p>
    <p>
      It passed twenty yards from the quarry, Loveday no doubt imagining that
      Hogarth still worked there; but the quarry was some hundred and fifty
      yards from the trench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its course, nevertheless was toward the trench: and on walked deliberately
      the fluctuating rope, the staff now travelling the gorsey ground, now
      bounding like a kangaroo yards high, to come down once more yonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment came when Hogarth, with intense hiss, was whispering to himself:
      &ldquo;If I were he, I should dash <i>now</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Fred Bates did not move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth suffered agonies not less excruciating than the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, whyever does he wait?&rdquo; he groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now&mdash;all suddenly&mdash;it was known, it was felt, deep in five
      hundred ecstatic hearts, that a convict was gone&mdash;a man overboard&mdash;a
      soul in the agony&mdash;battling between life and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like tempests the whistles split the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where is he? Who is he? What mother bare him? It is 57! And he is <i>there!</i>&mdash;on
      high&mdash;caught, to the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tumbling of four ballast bags from the balloon was marked: the balloon
      darted high, wildly high; and with her, seated on the bar, the cord
      between his thighs, darted high Fred Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exultant! the five hundred faces wax fire-eyed, each heart a flame of
      madness. But yonder is Warder Black taking trembling, yet careful, aim:
      now the report is echoing from the two Tors, the granite-works; and that
      smoke no sooner thins than a whole volley of crackling musketry is winging
      toward that dot under the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was hideous&mdash;pitiful&mdash;the quailing heart waited and was
      still to see the dot dissever itself from its rod: he had been hit: was in
      the middle of the vast and vacant air: and wheeling he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shockingly protracted interval did that fall fill up: the five hundred,
      gazing as at some wonder in heaven, did not, could not, breathe: the
      outraged heart seemed to rend the breast in a shriek. Would it <i>never</i>
      end, that somersault? Wheeling he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality it occupied much less than a minute: and now he is no more
      ethereal, but has grown, is grossly near, attended by the raving winds of
      his travelling: is arrived. And the thump of his coming was heard. As he
      touched the earth he jerked out circular....
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a tragedy remembered many a year at Colmoor, and always with
      feelings of the deepest awe.

    <h2>
      XVII. &mdash; OLD TOM'S LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The fate of Bates filled Hogarth's mind with a gloom so funereal, that now
      his strength, his great patience, all but succumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, while his broom lay stuck out under the notch of his
      cell-door in order that Warder Black might count him, he took his tin
      knife, and began to scratch over the hills and valleys of his corrugated
      wall some shining letters:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     VEN
</pre>
    <p>
      He was now, after long reflection, convinced that he was the victim of a
      plot of Baruch Frankl's: yet in his heart was little rancour against
      Frankl, nor, when he wrote his &ldquo;V E N&rdquo;, was he thinking specially of
      Frankl&mdash;hardly knew of whom, or what. It may have been of the system
      of things which had given to Frankl such vast powers over him; but, the
      &ldquo;N&rdquo; finished, he pshawed at himself, and threw the knife down. If
      something was wrong, he knew not at all how to right it, supposing the
      world had been his to guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a simple incident was destined to transform his mood&mdash;a letter
      from old Tom Bates, the father of Fred.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as hitherto we have seen him passive, bearing his weight of pain with
      patience, after that letter we shall find him in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Bates' letter was handed him three weeks after the scratching of his
      vague &ldquo;VEN&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours trule,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;TOM BATES&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old fellow, Hogarth saw, did not know of Fred's fate: Fred, the last
      of eight. He would find it hard to answer that letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      When &ldquo;beds down&rdquo; was called, his head was still full of one thought: old
      Tom Bates; and he could not sleep; heard the bell ring for the change of
      warders; the vast silence of the prison's night; and still his brain
      revolved old Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stealthy slipper of the night-warder passed and re-passed. Anon a
      click of metal on metal, and the bull's-eye searched him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he remembered that visit to the forge at Thring, and the present
      of herrings which old Tom in his guernsey, had brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;take 'em&mdash;they're yours&rdquo;, old Tom had said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had just then, he remembered, been on the point of going into the
      cottage to examine his guns, when the old man came, and stopped him&mdash;a
      fatal, appointed thing, apparently. Had he actually gone, he would have
      found the guns vanished, and would never have been condemned....
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was it that the old man had said about fish, and fishermen, and
      the sea?
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent his brow to it, and finally remembered: &ldquo;The day's work of a
      fisherman gives him enough fish to live on all the week, and he could lie
      round idling the other six days, if he chose; only anybody can't live on
      nothing but fish all the time&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it true? Yes! He remembered facts of Yarmouth....
    </p>
    <p>
      But since true, it was&mdash;strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was the sea, then, a more productive element for men to work in than the
      land? No, that was absurd: the land, in the nature of things, was more
      productive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, why could not <i>all</i> men procure an easy superfluity by one
      day's work, as the fisher could, if he chose to live naked in a cave,
      eating fish alone? In that case the fisher could change some of his
      day's-work fish for the shore people's day's-work things, and so all have
      a variety as well as superabundance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the interest of this question, he leapt from his hammock, peering into
      that thing, and his fleet feet were away, running after the truth with
      that rapt abandonment that had characterized his hunting and football.
      This was clear: that there was some difference between land and sea as
      working-grounds for men. Shore people, like a shoemaker, did not have for
      themselves enough shoes from even five, or six, days' work on which to
      live in plenty for a week: and hence would take nothing less than an
      enormous quantity of the fisher's fish in exchange for a pair of shoes,
      making him, too, poor as themselves. But since land work was as productive
      as sea work, and far more so, it could only be that the shoemaker did not
      get for himself all the shoes which he made, as the fisher got for himself
      all the fish which he caught: some power took from shore people a large
      part of what they made, a power which did not exist on the sea. That much
      was sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was this power, this inherent difference?
    </p>
    <p>
      He could think of no inherent difference except this: that shore workers
      paid rent for land&mdash;directly and indirectly&mdash;in a million subtle
      ways; but fishers paid none for the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, then, if shore folk paid no rent, they would have a still greater
      superfluity of shoes, etc., from one day's labour in six than the
      fish-rich fisher?
    </p>
    <p>
      So it seemed. So it <i>was</i>&mdash;as with savages. He started! But one
      minute's reflection showed him that it was in the very nature of the shore
      to pay rent: because one piece of land was better than another&mdash;City
      land, for instance&mdash;and those working on the better must pay for that
      benefit. Civilized land, therefore, was bound to pay rent.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that the shore people could never have the easy superfluity of the
      fish-rich fisher&mdash;because land was bound to pay rent? And the fisher
      must buy the shore things so dear with his easy-got fish, toiling, he,
      too, all the week&mdash;because land was bound to pay rent?
    </p>
    <p>
      The wretchedness of Man, then, was a Law?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, confronted by a wall, groaned, and while his body was cold, his
      brow rolled with sweat, he feeling himself on the brink of some truth
      profound as the roots of the mountains....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land was bound to pay rent&rdquo;: he reached that point; and there remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose the workers on shore paid the rent <i>among themselves</i>....?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last those words: and he gave out a shout which begat mouths of echo
      through the galleries of Colmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If the workers on shore paid rent among one another&rdquo;&mdash;then they
      would&mdash;on the whole&mdash;be in the very position of the fish-rich
      workers on sea, who paid no rent at all, the nation&mdash;as a whole&mdash;living
      on its country rent-free: England English, America American, as the sea
      human: and our race might then begin to think, to live!
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed too sublime&mdash;and divine&mdash;to be true! Again, point by
      point, he went over his reasoning with prying eye; and, on coming back to
      the same conclusion, hugged himself, moaning. At last&mdash;he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      And away now with the dullness and lowness! That blithe and hand-clapping
      day! Good-bye, Colmoor! the daily massacre, the shame and care. Men could
      begin&mdash;if in a baby way at first&mdash;to think, to see, to sing, to
      live.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, indeed, that that would hardly have been fair business if he, for
      example, had paid his rent to the English Nation instead of to Frankl,
      Frankl having bought Lagden with money earned. But he thought that Frankl
      would hardly be slow to resign that rent, if once he was shown....
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Frankl <i>was</i> slow&mdash;what then?
    </p>
    <p>
      The oblong of ribbed glass over his flap-table showed a greyness of
      morning, as he asked himself that thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that case&mdash;Frankl could be argued with.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he still refused?
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the question could be gone into as to whether that which is good for
      forty millions, though apparently bad for Frankl, is not <i>forty million
      times</i> more just than unjust, goodness being justice; also, as to which
      had the primary right to England, Frankl or the English.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he still refused?
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Hogarth giggled&mdash;his first laugh in Colmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>That</i> could be arranged....
    </p>
    <p>
      For him, Hogarth, the great fact was this: that he saw light. Into that
      humble cell the rays of Heaven had blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After standing motionless a long time, he dropped to his knees, and &ldquo;O,
      Thou, Thou&rdquo;, he said....
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, when asked by an orderly if he wished to see doctor or
      governor, he replied: &ldquo;The Governor&rdquo;.

    <h2>
      XVIII. &mdash; CHLOROFORM
    </h2>
    <p>
      (Captain Bucknill, the Governor, was making his morning rounds, when he
      heard that among the convicts claiming to see him was 76.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A little man, prim, snappy, compact: an army officer, with moustachios
      stuck upon him, to curve and finish him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what is it, 76?&rdquo; said he busily at the cell door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth struck a hand-salute&mdash;his old habit on His Majesty's ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, I wished to tell you that I have determined to escape from this
      prison&mdash;if I can&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, now! This is a most refreshing candour, 76!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have said what I had to say&rdquo;, said Hogarth. &ldquo;You keep a sharp eye on
      me, and I, too, will keep a sharp eye&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor puffed a breath of laughter, turned on his heels, walked
      away, and that day spoke to three officials with regard to Convict 76.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during a week Hogarth lay deep, chained, in a punishment-cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      But during its first four days he had invented three separate plans of
      escape, and had determined upon the one which seemed the surest, though
      longest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he again came up into the light, he was a marked man, under Warder
      Black's constant suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, however, his expression was changed: he no longer belonged to
      Colmoor, though he was there. Sometimes he felt like shouting at the
      burden of his secret. In his impatience to proclaim it, he pined to write
      to Loveday&mdash;but now his punishment had lost him that privilege.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the problem was to get ten good miles beyond Colmoor: a hard
      one; but his brain had already accomplished a task far harder: and the
      greater implied the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought, when he had begun to plan, had been Loveday; his
      second, that on no account could he permit Loveday to incur further risk,
      or expense, for him; his third, that he might yet use Loveday to any
      extent not involving risk or expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the next weekly &ldquo;School&rdquo; he sat near a Thames-works hackle-maker, who,
      though he could write, was no scholar, and was laboriously spoiling a
      second letter-sheet, when Hogarth whispered him: &ldquo;Can I help you? I see
      it's to your mother. I could get her a quid from a friend of mine&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm much obliged....!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laborious letter, after half an hour, had in it:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go to 15, Cheyne Gardens, the gentleman will give you a sovereign
      which he owed me for cutting down the elm in the beech-wood at Teddington
      for him&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Loveday lived at 15, Cheyne Gardens, and had only to see those words
      &ldquo;<i>the elm in the beechwood</i>,&rdquo; to scent a cypher from Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered five pounds for that letter: but it was two weeks before he
      decided upon the intended words: &ldquo;Small chloroform&mdash;trenches&mdash;rock&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were several trenches, many rocks: yet one midnight, when a
      blustering wind huddled the bracken, and the prison stood darkling,
      wrapped in mystery, a lonely figure in an ulster was there; and under each
      of three rocks he deposited two vials: for the formation of only three
      gave the least chance of concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Hogarth's plan could be he racked his brain in vain to dream,
      guessing that prisoners, on returning from the moor, must be searched,
      even to the ears: Hogarth, therefore, could never use the vial within the
      walls, and must mean to use it without&mdash;a sufficiently wild
      proceeding. But the finding of the vials, was sure: for the &ldquo;rock&rdquo; which
      Hogarth had had in mind was one of those granite ones common on Colmoor,
      standing five feet high on a small base; and one day he swept his hand
      among the gorse under it, and, with a glad half-surprise, touched two
      vials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days later he again swept his hand among the gorse, touched the
      vials, breasted his handkerchief, laid the vials on it, and presently
      contrived to tie them together with a twig.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his feet now was a wheelbarrow full of marl, and two yards off Warder
      Black, waiting for him to roll the barrow; but, inserting his spade
      between a wheel and a side of the barrow, his back toward Black, Hogarth,
      with a tug, bent the spade: then walked to Black.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;that spade isn't much good now....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Black strode to look, Hogarth a little behind him: and at the instant when
      the officer was a-stoop to lift the spade, Hogarth took the vials from his
      breast, and laid them upright in the little pocket of Black's tunic, near
      his bayonet-sheath and cartridge-box, above the belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the matter of the spade was settled, the great bell rang, the
      gangs went marching over the old familiar level, up the old path in the
      grass-mound on which the Palace stands, and so, in lax order, like shabby
      French conscripts, powdered, toil-worn, into the gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the search on parade: during which, as Black busily searched him,
      Hogarth said: &ldquo;Search well&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were then led up to cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the moment Hogarth's door closed upon him, he put his skilly-can on
      the floor, and, with one stamp, stamped it out of shape; also he broke his
      cup, and pocketed two fragments of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes afterwards, before cocoa, Black, trotting in heavy haste
      here and there in the gallery, looked in to say: &ldquo;Bath to-night&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hogarth: &ldquo;Warder! a word with you! sorry, I have trodden on my
      can....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Black went stooping to look, the can now standing on the low
      shelf; and as he said &ldquo;I shall report this&rdquo;, Hogarth, stooping, with quick
      deftness had the vials picked from the thick pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, fall in&rdquo;, said Black to him; &ldquo;better take your precious can, and
      give it to a bath-room warder for the store-keeper to change&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, as he passed out, placed the vials on the shelf over his door,
      where they were secure, since cells were never searched; and, the bathers
      having formed in single file, five feet between man and man, away they
      moved and down&mdash;away and down&mdash;lost in space, treading the
      journey of galleries, till, at the bottom, they passed up a vaulted
      corridor, monastically dim, across a yard open to starry sky, and into the
      door of a semi-detached, steep-roofed building, which was the bath-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A row of thirty-five baths; a very long bench for undressing; in the space
      between bench and baths three warders walking: such was the bath-house:
      all whitewashed, galvanized iron, and rigour; but for its old record of
      uneventfulness a scandal was preparing that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the door a fourth officer paced, and a cord within rang a little
      bell in one click, to tell when, the bathing over, the door should be
      unlocked outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      After giving up his can near the door to a warder, who laid it on the
      bench, Hogarth undressed slowly; got off his boots; and now had on only
      knickerbockers and stockings: he got off his stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the moment his bare soles touched the floor, he felt himself once more
      agile on the ratlines, larky for a shore-row, handy in any squall. Let
      them all come, therefore! He smiled; passed his palms down his crib of
      lean ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, why don't you hurry up there...?&rdquo; an officer came asking,
      stooping.
    </p>
    <p>
      At &ldquo;there&rdquo; he saw stars-and-stripes, dropped upon his back: Hogarth was
      away toward the door, while the bathers started with shouts, though in no
      bosom arose any impulse to follow, the bath-house being the centre of a
      maze of twenty unscaleable walls, prison within prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as for Hogarth, in such a dazzling flash did he dash toward the door,
      that he had struck down the second officer before the outcry of the first,
      and had pulled at the door-bell before the third could cry <i>&ldquo;Don't
      open!&rdquo;</i>&mdash;a cry muffled into his maw by a cuff prompt as thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      This third man, however, grasped the fugitive by the middle: and while the
      overthrown two were running up, and the key without seeking the lock, a
      short, venomous tussle was waged just near the door, till Hogarth,
      wringing his naked body free, tossed his antagonist by the knees to slide
      into the path of the two on-comers; at the same time, catching up his
      battered can, and smashing it into the face of the door-orderly, who now
      peeped in, he slipped through, and was gone into a yard, small, of
      irregular shape, and dim, with one wall-lantern, and but one egress
      (except the egress into the prison-hall), namely a blind-alley between the
      laundry and carpet-makers' building on one side, and stables on the other:
      blind alley, yard, and all, being shut in by big buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time the door-orderly opened his eyes, and one of the inside three
      had rushed out, Hogarth had vanished; and these two, shrilling whistles to
      reinforce the bath-room guard, pelted down the blind-alley to effect, as
      they thought, a sure capture. But Hogarth was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back they came trotting, breathless, rather at a loss. One panted: &ldquo;He
      must have run back into the great hall....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other panted: &ldquo;He'd hardly do that&mdash;hiding in the yard still, <i>must</i>
      be. There's that little nook....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;little nook&rdquo; is a three-sided space in a corner, very dark, formed by
      one wall of the campanile, or bell-tower, together with a wall of the
      laundry-house, and a third wall which shuts in the yard; the entrance to
      it narrow, and one looking up within it seems to stand at the bottom of a
      triangular well, split at one corner. It is not far from the bathhouse,
      and into it Hogarth had really darted; but when the officers came peering,
      no trace of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had, in fact, gone up the lightning-conductor, which runs down a
      bell-tower remarkably high, Colmoor having been built during the
      Napoleonic wars for French prisoners at a time when the theory was
      accepted that a lightning-conductor protects a space whose radius is
      double the height of the conductor. The tower is a five-sided structure
      with a Gothic window into which it is impossible to get from the
      conductor, because a corner intervenes, and it is a feat to swing from the
      conductor to the laundry-wall coping, and thence, leaping up, to grip the
      window: at each of which ordeals Hogarth hesitated, pierced with chills;
      to his observations from afar it had seemed so much less stupendous; but
      in each case he dared, and reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time the can was between his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived on the window, his arms out groping, he felt a slanting beam&mdash;climbed
      it&mdash;found it short-mounted upon a horizontal one, all here, as he had
      expected, being a chaos of beams, raying every way. Thrice he sneezed low,
      and felt cobwebs in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      And groping he went, seeking the great Bell of Colmoor, which he had
      doomed, hearing sounds of the to-do, echoes that ran below, and the vague
      shout of somebody, till he touched the flat top of the bell, clamped to
      the swing-beam on which he sat astraddle; felt also that along the top of
      the beam lay an iron bar; made sure that this was in actual contact with
      the clamps of the bell: and, no longer hesitating, set to work upon the
      can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tugging with his dog-teeth under the upper rim, he got a loose end, and
      wrenched the rim off; then, tearing along the solder, got the cylinder
      separated from the bottom; and, opening it out, had a sheet of tin. And
      now, by the help of his fragments of cup, he set to hack-sawing, breaking,
      tearing this into strips, no easy thing, in spite of the thin-worn
      condition of the can: but finally had six strips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The edge of one strip he inserted under an end of the bar of iron on the
      beam; then connected that strip with another by loops, slid again to the
      window, and there lay connecting the six strips by a smith's-trick, with
      skew loops, non-slipping, getting a tin string five feet long. He then
      took the leap to the laundry coping, and thence the spring to the
      conductor, this being all the more ticklishly perilous because he could
      barely see it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hanging away now from the conductor by the left elbow, he reached out the
      right arm across the corner to catch the tin, which stuck toward him from
      the window: and he wound its end round the conductor, electrically
      connecting the bell with the conductor.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, standing with one foot on a staple below the tin, he twice sawed
      the conductor's soft metal with the fragments of cup, cutting and tugging
      out three inches of it, thus isolating the conductor's point atop from its
      earthing; then he tossed the piece cut out behind the laundry-coping.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, he listened, cast a searching eye below, slid down the rod.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yard was at present silent, but as he moved to give himself up in the
      prison-hall, five night-warders with bull's-eyes fell out, still seeking
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he knelt with clasped hands of supplication and bent bare back,
      like a captured slave, they fell savagely upon him, and cried one: &ldquo;Well,
      of all the idiots...!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      XIX. &mdash; THE GREAT BELL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next morning Hogarth was not marched out, and near dinner-time was
      summoned before the Governor. Here he stood in a cage of bars in a room of
      &ldquo;No.1&rdquo; prison, devoted to prison-offences; and before him, at a littered
      table, sat governor and chief warder, with the witnesses of the outbreak
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was gone into, the report made: whereupon the Governor looked up
      and down the length of Hogarth, and suddenly gave vent to a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, No. 76&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;this was the threatened escape?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth was now all contrition and hanging head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg for mercy&rdquo;, he said, with a little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I am not your judge...Where were you when the officers were looking
      for you in the yard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was hiding in that little nook&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Confounded carelessness on someone's part...And what cut and swelled your
      mouth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I bashed into the wall in the nook&rdquo; (The can had cut him!).
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have been mad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next two weeks he had round his ankles a chain which, rising in
      two loops, was fastened to a band round his waist; and he was set to turn
      &ldquo;the crank&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, he was led forth to stand before the periodic Director, who,
      after reading the report, turned to a volume of writing in which was
      Hogarth's record: good&mdash;till lately; and the Director addressed him
      with sternness, which yet was paternal: he would sentence him to one month
      in a punishment cell, to two months in chains, and to one dozen lashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And two days later he was led to the flogging-hall, which, as he
      approached it, sent forth screams; the doctor looked at him and consented;
      the Governor said: &ldquo;Get it over&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth stripped to the waist, his teeth chattering: but not with fear. On
      the contrary, he felt a touch of exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wrists of his outstretched arms having been bound to &ldquo;the triangle&rdquo;,
      the Governor gave the sign, the cat rose, and sang, and fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly up, and whistlingly down, rasping, reaping. At the seventh shock he
      fainted: and thence onward had a long dream, in which he saw Rebekah
      Frankl in Hindoo dress and jewellery, and she threw at him a red rose
      black at heart with passion, and her body balanced in dance, and her hands
      clapped at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the next month he tholed the cold of that same punishment-cell; and
      during the next was in his old cell, but in chains, picking oakum. All
      this time, if he was aware of high winds by night, he was in an agony,
      till the next day the great bell rang its treble.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of February he was once more trenching in the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a fear had stolen into his mind: for the string of tin was not strong,
      and the winds of the last month may have dislocated it. In any case, he
      might have to wait a year, two, ten....
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally he would redden with suppressed and turbulent energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the 17th of March, toward evening, England was visited by a storm
      long remembered, lasting three days, during which the poor prisoners were
      comforted with rations of hot soup and cocoa.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the fourth day when the gangs were once more taken out
      Hogarth was hardly conscious of frigid winds or agued limbs: for three
      days the great bell of Colmoor had not rung; and his ears were open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the prisoners, who, by practised instinct, get to know the moment at
      which it should sound, three presently straightened up, spade in hand, to
      glance at the prison: and suddenly heard&mdash;a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dull something somewhere&mdash;from the prison? unless it was some shock
      of the wind...Hogarth gazed piteously into the faces near him...No one
      seemed to have heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds, like eternities...Then he saw a warder look at his watch;
      then&mdash;another! and&mdash;they glanced at the prison; and&mdash;they
      approached each other; and&mdash;they laid whispering heads together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then&mdash;joy!&mdash;came five officers, wildly running from the prison
      gates, calling, waving....
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he knew, and smiled: the babble of that lalling tongue was dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the very next day, when the afternoon-gangs were marching out, they
      saw descending from a carriage before the Deputy Governor's house a
      gentleman with a roll of diagram-paper&mdash;a bell-foundry expert,
      summoned by telegraph from Cardiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth resolved to act that night.

    <h2>
      XX. &mdash; THE INFIRMARY
    </h2>
    <p>
      As soon as the cell-door clicked upon him, he commenced to work: first
      took off his boots; then felt over the doorshelf for the chloroform; wet
      his handkerchief with some of it: then inserted the vials across the toes
      of his boots, which were a succession of wrinkles, far too large; then put
      on the boots again.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then lay on the floor, close to the low shelf; and, pressing the
      handkerchief over his mouth and nose, breathed deep, knowing that in four
      minutes, when he did not obey the order of &ldquo;brooms out&rdquo;, his cell would be
      opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he sank deeper and deeper into dream, it was with a concentration of
      his will upon one point&mdash;the handkerchief, which, if smelled by
      anyone, would ruin all; and finally, as he drew the last gasp of
      consciousness, he waved it languidly from him under the shelf; then, with
      a sigh, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had known that he must have about his body the unmistakable signs of an
      abnormal condition in order to sleep a night in the infirmary&mdash;which
      was what he wanted. And thither, when shakings and the bull's-eye had
      sufficiently tested him, he was swung away, and the doctor's assistant
      summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth's pupils were hurriedly examined, his heartbeat tested; and the
      freshman frowned, smelling an odour which, in another place, might have
      been chloroform, but here was pharyngitis; and he muttered, &ldquo;Digitalis,
      perhaps....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From a table Hogarth was swung to a bed by two of those well-behaved
      convicts who act as hospital-orderlies, and there two hours later had all
      his wits about him, and a racking headache.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first thought was his boots&mdash;expecting to find them under his
      stretcher, and himself in flannels; but he had them still on, and also his
      work-clothes, humanity to the sick in the first stages not being in the
      Colmoor code.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent half an hour in stealthily tearing a square foot from his
      shirt-tail; then, weary and sick, went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, soon after 3 A.M. his eyes again opened, all was still. He lay in a
      long room, rather dim, in the midst of a row of stretchers which were shut
      in by bars containing locks and gates, and on the other side of the room a
      row of stretchers, shut in by bars. At a table in the middle, on which
      were bottles, lint, graduated glasses, sat a warder, with outstretched
      legs and fallen head: near him, standing listless, a convict
      hospital-orderly, who continually edged nearer the stove; and, half-way
      down the room, another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally there were calls from the sick-beds&mdash;whispered shouts&mdash;apologetic
      and stealthy, as of men guiltily conscious of the luxury of being ill; but
      neither night-warder nor orderlies made undue haste to hear these
      summonses. There was, beside, an octagonal clock, which ticked excessively
      in the stillness, as though the whole place belonged to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth took off his boots under his blanket, and from them took out the
      vials; then, sitting up, commenced to call the warder, at the same time
      wetting the torn piece of shirt with some of the fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'm coming&mdash;shut up!&rdquo; said the warder, but did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Hogarth grew loud; and the warder, presently rousing his drowsy bulk,
      unlocked the gate of that compartment, as Hogarth said to himself: &ldquo;Do it
      handy...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as the warder stooped, Hogarth clapped the rag upon his mouth and
      nose. A struggle followed a muffled sob, both standing upright now, till
      the warder began to paw the air, sank, toppled upon the bed, whereupon
      Hogarth slipped into the blanket again, and called out in the voice of the
      warder: &ldquo;Come here, Barrows&mdash;see if this man is dead &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had now drawn the warder over him, holding up his chest with one arm,
      had also poured chloroform upon the rag, and when the convict-orderly
      came, Hogarth, by means of a short struggle, had him asleep, then seized
      the warder's truncheon and keys, and ran out in his stockinged feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that sight, the sick, the dying, the two rows of stretchers, were up on
      elbow, gazing with grins. To the second convict-orderly who came running
      to meet him Hogarth hissed: &ldquo;Not a word&mdash;or I brain you with this! If
      I tie your feet, you won't have to answer for anything. Come along....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was an old fellow, and when he realized the impending truncheon, the
      menace of Hogarth's eyes, and the silence of the warder, he permitted
      himself to be dragged toward Hogarth's stretcher; and his feet were
      quickly knotted in his own stockings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now again Hogarth ran: but not many steps, when he felt himself tapped on
      the back, and, glancing in a horror of alarm, saw one of the two patients
      who had occupied with him his cage of bars&mdash;a wiry, long-faced
      Cockney shop-boy, who had had his ankle crushed by a rock at the quarry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you off?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's <i>my</i> business&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you don't. Part, or I give the alarm&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Do you want to come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;your foot's sick, you fool&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll carry me in your awms, as a father beareth his children....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are cool! What are you in for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder, my son-red, grim, gory murder!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guilty, ya'as. What do <i>you</i> think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you may go to hell&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>'Ell</i> is it? I'm <i>there</i>: and if I linger longer loo in it,
      you linger, too, swelp me Gawd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth was nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the foot...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind the <i>foot</i>. Foot's still good for a run. Do we go
      shares?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come along, then&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you ain't 'alf up to snuff, I can see, though you are pretty smart in
      your own way: I'd 'ave felt the confidence of a son in you, if you 'adn't
      overlooked that wine&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To Hogarth's dismay, he turned back to the table, put a black bottle, half
      full, to his lips, and with tilts anc stoppages set to gulp it, while
      eager jokes, touched with jealousy, began to jeer from the beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lawd Gawd, that was good!&rdquo; said the Cockney with upturned eyes, &ldquo;and what
      do I behold?&mdash;broth, ye gawds!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now a saucepan of cold broth was at his lips; and not till he had drunk
      all did he run after Hogarth into the other arm of the ward, where one of
      the keys unlocked the door at its end, and they passed out into the
      infirmary exercise-hall, now dark, Hogarth dragging the Cockney, who
      limped, and kept up a prattle of tipsy ribaldries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, emerging upon a platform of slabs, from which the jump into the
      infirmary exercise-yard is twenty feet, Hogarth leapt. The Cockney stood
      hesitating on the brink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As sure as my name's 'Arris, you'll be the bloomin' ruin of me...&rdquo; he
      said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h</i>&rdquo;, went Hogarth, &ldquo;one more word, and I leave or knock you
      speechless&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at last Harris jumped, Hogarth catching him, and they ran across the
      yard northerly, Harris complaining of cold, being in hospital flannels,
      his feet bare, Hogarth bitterly regretting the burden of this companion,
      meditating on deserting him. Accordingly, when they had run down a
      passage, and were confronted by a great gate, spiked a-top, Hogarth said:
      &ldquo;I'll get up first&rdquo;, and, forcing the small end of the truncheon into the
      space at the hinges, he got foot-hold from which he caught the top hinge
      and scaled, a feat of which he considered Harris incapable; and, instead
      of helping him up, leapt down with a new feeling of lightness, hearing
      from the other side &ldquo;Dastardly treachery...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he ran through dark night wild with winds wheeling snowflakes; and,
      seeing in the unpaved court in which he now was a clothes-line supported
      on stakes, he seized both, to run with them to where the court is bounded
      by the great outer wall: for though it is thirty feet of sheer rock, the
      mere fact of stakes being found there, and of a vanished rope, would
      furnish grounds for the belief that he had scaled it: he therefore leant
      the stakes against it, and kept the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      About to turn, he felt his back touched; and, spinning round, saw Harris
      panting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a friend that sticketh closer than any bloomin' brother, Mr. 76&rdquo;,
      Harris said. &ldquo;Try that game on again, and I give myself up; and where will
      <i>you</i> be then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You silly wretch!&rdquo; said Hogarth: &ldquo;before I am free, there'll be a hundred
      difficulties and pains. Are you prepared to undergo them? You couldn't, if
      you tried&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bear ye one another's burdens, it <i>is</i>&rdquo;, said Harris: &ldquo;with thee by
      me what need I fear? Lawd Gawd, that wine was good! it's got into my poor
      'ead, I believe. On, general; where thou leadest, I will follow&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth looked at him, half inclined to knock him down, and half to
      shelter, and save.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&rdquo;, said he. &ldquo;Can you climb?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Climb, yes, like a bag of monkeys&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, then&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mounted three low steps before four doors at the north end of the
      infirmary buildings, where, as he had observed from the moor, a spout runs
      up the wall at its east end; and up this he began to climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Old on!&rdquo; called Harris: &ldquo;I can't do that lot&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h!</i>&mdash;you must!&mdash;come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harris made three attempts before he reached the first footrest, and there
      stuck, vowing in loud whispers that he would no further go, and Hogarth
      had to come back, and encourage him up. Finally, they went running
      southward on the leads between the infirmary roof and its coping, and had
      hardly reached the south end when a whistle shrilled, and they saw a
      warder run across the exercise-yard with a lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stoop!&rdquo; whispered Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crouching, they stole along the south coping, and thence dropped to a flat
      cistern-top, Hogarth, with a painful &ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h</i>&rdquo;, catching Harris as
      he fell, for the signs of alarm and activity every moment increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up a series of little brick steps, the base of a chimney over the kitchen&mdash;then
      across another stretch of leads beneath which is the tailor's shop&mdash;then,
      stealing in shadow under the beams of overhanging eaves by a garret
      window, behind which was a light, and someone moving&mdash;then a spring
      of three feet between two cornices&mdash;then a running walk at a height
      of a hundred feet along a beading four inches wide, holding on with the
      upstretched arms&mdash;then, with course changed from south to east, along
      more leads&mdash;then a climb of ten feet up a glazed main&mdash;and now
      they were skulking behind the coping of the great No. 2 prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, contiguous with the back of the bath-house is a wall which runs from
      No. 2 prison to the bell-tower, dividing the bath-house yard from the
      bell-yard; but the top is not horizontal, being lower at the bell-tower
      end, neither is it broad, and to reach it from the prison coping a drop of
      seven feet is necessary: this Harris refused to do. &ldquo;Not for Joe&rdquo;, said
      he: &ldquo;I've already run my 'ead into enough perils by land and sea on your
      account. If this is what you've brought me out moonlighting here for....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth did not wait, but disappeared over the side: and Harris, after
      five minutes' pleadings, followed. They then drew on the belly to the
      bell-tower; and here again Harris refused the leap to the conductor. When
      finally he dared, and Hogarth sought to steady him, as he came sprawling
      upon the rod, both went gliding down, till checked by a staple.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they climbed again; Hogarth undid the half-fused string of tin from
      the conductor, swung to the laundry coping, caught Harris, leapt to the
      window, drew up Harris; and was ensconced far up among the beams in thick
      darkness in the belfry an hour before daybreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time the great gates were open, and the moor being scoured for the
      two.

    <h2>
      XXI. &mdash; IN THE DEEP
    </h2>
    <p>
      They had not been ten minutes in the tower when Harris began to whine of
      the cold; whereupon Hogarth took off his slop-jacket and waistcoat, and
      put them upon the Cockney.
    </p>
    <p>
      As from two sound-escapes far down near the bell some twilight came in,
      near eight Hogarth descended, working from beam to beam, to find that on
      one side the bell-metal had been melted into a lumpish mass, its rim
      shrivelled up, leaving an empty space under the motto <i>Laudate Domino</i>
      (mistake for <i>Dominum</i>) <i>omnes gentes</i>; and on the opposite side
      ran a crack from top to rim. Sliding still lower on a slanting beam, he
      could look obliquely upward into the bell's interior, and see the clapper,
      a mass weighing eight hundredweight, and so long, that quite down at the
      bell's rim were two hollows where it had constantly struck. It, too, had
      been blasted; but the bell-rope hung intact from a short beam at right
      angles to the swing beam; and, having found this much, he searched where
      he had left the bottom of his tin can, and clambered back with it into the
      upper regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven, lying along two beams, they could see the portal below
      opened, and four men came in, looking unreal and small; whereupon the
      leverage wheel was pulled, the swing-beam swung, the bell struck the
      clapper, and throughout the tower growled grum sounds: after which the
      four stood talking half an hour, and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later&mdash;it must have been after the forty minutes'
      dinner-interval&mdash;about twenty convicts entered with two warders,
      bearing three ladders. When these had been fastened together and set up,
      and the leverage wheel removed, they went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was evidently to be slow work. Not till about four did a solitary man
      mount the ladder, and take stand, far down under the bell, gazing up a
      long while, with stoops, and changes of posture. Hogarth thought that it
      was the bell-foundry expert whom he had seen; but could only guess: for
      all here was dim and remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now he had sawed the clothes-line into two pieces with the tin, one
      piece eight feet, the other much longer&mdash;had intended tearing his
      clothes into strips for ropes, but the clothes-line was still better. In
      both ropes he made knots for hand-hold, a large knot at one end of the
      short one, and he attached the string of tin to the other end. Descending
      now, he tied the longer rope round the swingbeam, let himself down to the
      rim of the bell, and with the right hand pushed the tin into the hole in
      which the clapper swung, reaching up, until the tin over-balanced, ran,
      and toppled down beside the clapper; drawing the tin now, he brought the
      rope down till it was stopped by the knot; and now, by a swing off from
      rope to rope, could climb into the bell. He then reascended, taking the
      longer rope, and the tin, with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As night fell, he judged that by the next he would succumb. Happily,
      Harris, who had eaten later than he, was snoring in a nook; but toward
      morning began to whine again, and sulk, and kept it up all the day. Not a
      soul now entered, and as the blackness of night once more filled the
      place, Harris threw up the sponge, with &ldquo;Here goes for this child....!&rdquo;
       Hogarth flew across the space which divided them, and a quarrel of cats
      ensued, both being under the influence of the fury called
      &ldquo;hunger-madness&rdquo;. It was only when Harris felt the grip of Hogarth at his
      windpipe that he squealed submission, whereupon Hogarth threw himself
      away; and half the night they sat, nothing but four eyes, eyeing each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night what was a revival of the great gale took place, belling like
      bucks about their heads, and noising through the tower in many a voice.
      This so increased their sense of desolation, that even the heart of
      Hogarth fainted, they like castaways on some ocean whose glooms no sunrise
      ever goldens; and now a doubt arose whether, even if the bell were removed
      on the morrow, Harris would have strength to cling on during the descent.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, early the next day hope revived when five men entered, four
      mounting among the beams to the swing-beam with tools, one at the
      ladder-head shouting up orders; and Hogarth, when they had gone, whispered
      Harris: &ldquo;They have been unscrewing the sockets in which the bell-beam
      swings&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them unscrew away&rdquo;, said Harris, his chin shivering on his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five more hours; during which only once did three men enter, seeming to do
      nothing but talk, with upward glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at three it was evident that there was considerable to-do, though
      above there the row of the winds drowned all sound. A crowd, chiefly of
      convicts, passed in and out; then twelve men, one after the other, ran up
      the ladder, and thence climbed among the beams, with six cables. Half went
      to the east, half to the west, side of the bell; and three of the cables
      were fastened round the swing-beam near one end, three near the other end;
      one three were then cast over a beam higher than the swing-beam, to the
      north of it; the other three cast over a beam to the south of it; and the
      six ends lowered&mdash;operations which Hogarth, lying on his face, could
      just see; and the twelve had hardly begun to descend, when he saw a lorry
      backed into the gateway, filling half 1 the area of the tower; whereupon
      over a hundred convicts were swarming over and round it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&rdquo;, said Hogarth; and he hurried down, tacking his way with slides and
      runs among the intricate beams, tied the rope to a beam above the
      swing-beam, and let himself down to the bell's rim; reached out then,
      caught the knotted rope that was within the bell, and climbed, the clapper
      now so rough, that hand and knee found grip; and he spent a minute in
      estimating his power of holding on with one arm, and with both, to its
      support-shaft.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he whispered Harris, and caught and half-sustained the Cockney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now they could hear echoes of the tongues below; and now Harris, clinging
      alternate with Hogarth, arms and legs, face to face, by rope and shaft and
      clapper, whispered: &ldquo;But-good Lord-look 'ere-there are some people coming
      up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Four convicts were indeed climbing: but even directly beneath the bell,
      where it was impossible to come, they would hardly have distinguished the
      forms huddled in its dark cavern, and their aim was higher, to stand
      ready, when the beam should lift, to swing it diagonally across the square
      of beams which had supported it, so that it might find space to descend.
      And soon the bell-beam stirred at the tightening ropes: the fugitives felt
      themselves swinging, rising, poised&mdash;descending.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were dizzily aware of shouted orders, the creaking of the toiling,
      slipping ropes, little jolts and stoppages, two hundred eyes blinking up,
      not seeing their cringed-up limbs&mdash;unnecessary cautious: for the
      nearer they descended to-ward the half-light, the surer did the area of
      the lorry make their invisibility. At last they were near; the bell
      lingered, swinging; babel was around them; the Governor's voice; a cheer:
      the bell was on the lorry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone struck the bell with a hammer, there was talk, swarmings round it,
      then shoulders pushed at the lorry wheels, which squealed and moved amid a
      still fussier babel drawn by four horses, and seven yoke of cattle. The
      fugitives could hear the opening of the great gate, the laborious exit,
      and, in a moment's pause, again the Governor talking, it seemed far off,
      to the expert....
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearily creaked the cart&mdash;beyond the moor&mdash;to a country road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now chattering words came from Harris: &ldquo;All damned fine! I don't deny that
      you know your way about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way out&rdquo;, said Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a gamesome sort of cock you are in all weathers...but what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Next' is to fall upon your knees and worship me, you cur&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou shalt worship the Lawd thy Gawd&rdquo;, chattered Harris; &ldquo;no bloomin'
      fear! This is only a new kind of punishment cell. You've got me in; 'ow
      are you going to get me out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth believed that the lorry was <i>en route</i> for the railway, and
      hoped to escape in the transfer of the bell; but that night lorry and bell
      slept in a shed outside a village <i>en route</i> for the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four A.M. they were again <i>en route</i>, and at intervals during the
      day, opening their now feeble and sleep-infected eyes, could hear the
      hoots of the two cattlemen, the sound of winds, the rowdy gait of the
      crooked-legged oxen, and stoppages for drink or rest, and anon an
      obstruction, with shouting and fuss. It was night before the waggon came
      to rest on a jetty, the elaborate day's journey done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fugitives were then deep in sleep, and only awoke at the rattle of a
      steam-crane in action above them, to find the bell beginning to tilt, lift
      and swing; then they were on a deck; and soon afterwards knew that it was
      a steamer's, when they heard the bray of her whistle, and presently were
      aware of blaring winds, and billows of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harris was for then and there crying out, but Hogarth, now his master,
      said: &ldquo;To-morrow morning&rdquo;; and they fell again into their morbid slumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they again awoke, uproar surrounded them, voices, a heaven-high
      shouting of quenched fires and screaming steams; moreover, the bell was
      leaning steeply, they two huddled together at its edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harris began to bellow: but he was not heard, or not heeded.... There had
      been a collision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can't swim, better catch hold of me&rdquo;, Hogarth shouted&mdash;&ldquo;there
      will be&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the earth turned turtle, and Hogarth felt himself struck on the
      shoulder, flung, and dragged down, down, into darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an upward climb and fight to slip the clutch of the ship's suction,
      in the middle of a heavy sea he managed to get off his clothes, and set to
      swimming, whither he did not know, a toy on mountains of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exultation raged in him&mdash;a crazy intoxication&mdash;at liberation
      attained, at the sensation of warmth, at all that water and waste of
      Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      But within ten minutes it is finished: he shivers, his false strength
      changing to paltriness, the waves washing now over his head; and now he is
      drowsing...drowning...

      XXII. &mdash; OLD TOM
    </h2>
    <p>
      He continued, however, to swim after his conscious efforts ceased: for his
      body was found next morning on a strip of Cornish sand between Gorran and
      Mevagissey, washed by every sheet of surf.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rescuer, a shrimp-fisher, occupied one of three cots perched on a
      ravine; and there on the evening of the second day he opened his eyes on a
      settee, four children screaming in play around him; he so far having been
      seen only by a reporter from Mevagissey, and the doctor from Gorran, who,
      on his wide rounds, had been asked into the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same night Hogarth spoke to the fisher: told him that he was not a
      wrecked sailor, had reasons for avoiding observation, and would pay for
      shelter and silence: whereat the fisher, who was drinking hot beer,
      winked, and promised; and the next day took for Hogarth a telegram, signed
      &ldquo;Elm Tree&rdquo;, to Mevagissey, asking of Loveday five pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, one midnight, after two weeks of skulking, he reached
      Whitechapel, where, the fact of his brown skin now giving him the idea of
      orientalizing himself, at a Jew's, in a little interior behind the
      counter, he bought sandals, a caftan, a black sudayree, an old Bagdad
      shawl for girdle, and a greenish-yellow Bedouin head-cloth, or kefie,
      which banded the forehead, draped the face like a nun's wimple, and fell
      loose. For these he discarded the shrimp-man's clothes; and now dubbed
      himself &ldquo;Peter the Hermit&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      For he meant to start-a Crusade.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a police-station on the third day he saw a description of himself:
      three moles, bloodshot eye, white teeth, pouting mouth; but over the moles
      now hung the head-cloth.
    </p>
    <p>
      For several days he lay low in a garret, considering himself, abandoning
      himself to sensuality in cocoa, vast buns, tobacco: rioting above all in
      the thought of the secret truth which lay in his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to now, not a word to anyone about it; but on the seventh night he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in some &ldquo;Cocoa Rooms&rdquo; in a &ldquo;first-class room&rdquo;, strewn with sawdust,
      where, as he sat alone, another man, bearing his jug, came and sat; and
      soon he addressed Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am an Englishman&rdquo;, answered Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, in those togs? What countryman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Norfolk&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know Manchester?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was there one day&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Difference between Manchester and London, isn't there? I am a Manchester
      man, I am. All the difference in the world. This cold, stiff, selfish
      city. Londoners, eh? A lot of peripatetic tombstones!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so he went on; this being his whole theory of God and Man: that
      Londoners are peripatetic tombstones, but Manchester-men just the other
      way&mdash;seemed a mechanic, brisk-eyed, small; a man who had read; but
      now, evidently, down on his luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, why come to London?&rdquo;&mdash;from Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking for work&rdquo;,&mdash;with a shrug&mdash;&ldquo;looking for a needle in a
      bundle of hay. What would you have? the whole place overrun with Jews.
      England no longer belongs to the English, that's the long and short of
      it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth looked him in the face. &ldquo;Did England belong to the English before
      the Jews came?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean? Of course it did&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which part of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, all of it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But fix your mind upon some particular piece of England&mdash;some
      street, or field, that you know&mdash;and then tell me: did that belong to
      the English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Belonged to some Englishman&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't mean to say that some Englishman is the English?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, yes, I know what you are driving at&rdquo;, said the mechanic, with a
      patronizing nod: &ldquo;but the point is this: that, apart from vague
      theorizing, a man did manage to make a good living before these dogs
      overran the country&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;a <i>good</i> living? How much did you make?&mdash;forty
      shillings a week? toiling in grime six days, sleeping the seventh? I call
      that a deadly living&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>don't</i>, you see. Besides, I made, not forty, but forty-<i>five</i>
      shillings, under the sliding-scale&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but no brave nation would submit one day to such petty squalors
      after it was shown the way to escape them&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There <i>is</i> no way&rdquo;, said the mechanic: &ldquo;there are the books, and the
      talkers; but the economic laws that govern the units like you and me are
      as relentless as gravitation. Don't believe anyone who talks to you about
      'ways of escape'&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose someone has a new thought?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There can be no new thoughts about <i>that</i>. The question has long
      since been exhausted&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, come &ldquo;&mdash;with sudden decision&mdash;&ldquo;I will tell you a thought
      of my own &ldquo;. And he told.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the English people paid the rent for England to themselves&mdash;to
      their government&mdash;instead of to a few Englishmen, then, by one day's
      labour in six, Englishmen would be much more rich in all things than a
      fisherman, by one day's labour in six, was rich in fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression which he awaited on the face before him was one of
      illuminated astonishment; but, with a chill in his nerves, he saw the
      workman's lips curve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said the Manchester man, &ldquo;that is an exploded theory!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <i>Exploded!!!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth was rather pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he knew that it was true....Who, then, could have been exploding the
      Almighty?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has exploded it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been exploded again and again!&rdquo; said the Manchester man; &ldquo;of all the
      theories of land-tenure, that is about the weakest: <i>I</i> should know,
      for I've studied them all. The fact is, no change in the system of
      land-tenure will have the least effect upon the lot of the masses; would
      only make things worse by unsettling the country&mdash;if it didn't mean a
      civil war&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to see&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth got up, walked home meditating: and suddenly blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was known! by mechanics in cocoa-rooms!&mdash;that secret thing of his
      secret cell. And it was not believed!
    </p>
    <p>
      As for him, what was he now doing outside Colmoor? That question he asked
      himself, as he sat unsandaling his feet; and he commenced to dress himself
      again: but paused&mdash;would first see Loveday.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, the next night, the two friends met at Cheyne Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a long time they sat silent, Loveday feeding his eyes upon his
      friend's face, that hard, rounded brow which seemed harder, and frowned
      now, that gallant largeness of eye which seemed now wilder, and that manly
      height, which seemed Mahomet's in the Oriental dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But where have you been for five weeks?&rdquo; asked Loveday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Skulking, and thinking. But about my sister....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not ask...&rdquo; said Loveday.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did not O'Hara tell you to make no more efforts for my escape?&rdquo; asked
      Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is O'Hara?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, the priest who escaped, instead of me, through the copse&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O'Hara was not the name he gave me; and no, he said nothing about that. I
      got him off to America, and only saw him twice. I thought him rather&mdash;But
      why didn't you escape youself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it improper&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you did finally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a reason: you remember the association which I was forming to answer
      the question as to the cause of misery? Well, that question I have
      answered for myself in prison&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Tell me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth absently took up a water-colour drawing from the table, and turned
      it round and round, leaning forward on a knee, as he told how the matter
      was. Meantime, he kept his eyes fixed upward upon Loveday's face, who
      stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his talk Loveday scratched the top of his head, where the
      hair was rather thin, and said he, twisting round: &ldquo;Forgive me-let me ring
      for some brandy-and-soda&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth stood briskly up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say, I can see, is not new to you?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not new&rdquo;, Loveday confessed: &ldquo;I believe that it is quite an ancient
      theory; there are even savage tribes whose land-tenure is not unlike what
      you advocate&mdash;the Basutos, for example&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And are these Basutos richer, happier, prettier fellows than average
      Englishmen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, beyond doubt. Don't suppose that I am gainsaying you: I am only
      showing you that the theory is not new&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why do you persist in calling it a <i>theory?</i> Is the fact that
      one and one make two a <i>theory?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Hogarth's brow growing every
      moment redder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can one call it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call it what you like! But do you believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is quite possibly true; and now that you say it I believe it; but I
      have never seriously considered the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because&mdash;I don't know. It is out of my line&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your line! Yet you are a human being&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, partly, yes: say&mdash;a novelist&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not jest! It is incredible to me that you have written book after
      book, and knew of this divine thing, and did not cram your books with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loveday flushed. &ldquo;You misunderstand my profession; and as to this theory
      of land-tenure, let me tell you: it will never be realized&mdash;not in
      England. Anyway, it would mean civil war....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again those words! &ldquo;Civil war....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as, for the second time, he heard them, Hogarth dashed the picture
      which he held to the ground, shattering glass and frame: which meant that,
      then and there, he washed his hands of the world and its wagging; meant
      also his return to Colmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dashed from the room without a word; down the stairs; out into the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he ran along the King's Road, he asked a policeman the way to the
      nearest police-station, then ran on through a number of smaller streets,
      seeking it, till, at a corner, he stopped, once more uncertain, the night
      dim and drizzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to set off again, when, behind him, he heard: &ldquo;Excuse me,
      mister&mdash;could you give a poor man a penny to get a night's lodging?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning, he saw&mdash;old Tom Bates: still in the guernsey; but very
      senile and broken now.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fish-rich fisher...! he had come to this...
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth had twenty-eight shillings about him, and, without disclosing
      himself, put hand to pocket to give them all, just as the old man reached
      up to his ear to say: &ldquo;It's the lumbago; I got it very bad; but it won't
      be long now. It wur a bad day for me as ever I come to Lunnon! I'm Norfolk
      born, I am: and I had eight sons, which the last was Fred, who, they say,
      met his death in Colmoor....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that word, &ldquo;Fred&rdquo;, Hogarth started: for under the elm in the beech-wood
      between Thring and Priddlestone Fred had concealed a thing fallen from
      heaven, which could be sold for&mdash;a thousand pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      That would keep the fisher rich during the few days that remained to him!
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old man could hardly go himself; if he could, would bungle: the
      thing was heavy&mdash;on the lord-of-the-manor's land....
    </p>
    <p>
      Do a kind act, Hogarth. He would see the old place, his father's grave;
      and there was a girl who lived in the Hall at Westring whom it was a
      thrilling thing to be near, even if one did not see....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are two shillings&rdquo;, said he, in an assumed voice: &ldquo;and if you be at
      this spot, at this hour, on Thursday night coming, you shall have more.
      Don't fail&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he ran, and took train, two hours later, for Beccles.

    <h2>
      XXIII. &mdash; UNDER THE ELM
    </h2>
    <p>
      His risk of arrest here, round about his old home, was enormous, and he
      drew the Bedouin kefie well round his face, skulking from the station to
      the &ldquo;Fen&rdquo;, northward, where he got an urchin to buy him a paper lantern in
      a general shop, and now trudged up to Priddlestone, then down through
      meadows to the beech-wood, the night rough with March winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the winds, however, which made him draw close his Arab cloak,
      but his approach to the elm: there, one night, he had seen a naked black
      man! there had fallen the Arab Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood twenty yards from the tree, till, with sudden resolution, he
      strode, soon had the lantern ruby, and since the grave of &ldquo;the affair&rdquo; had
      been digged with a piece of wood, for such a piece he went seeking, having
      thrown off his caftan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead, he found the rusted half-blade of a spade, and commenced to dig
      round the roots, the lantern shine reddening a face strangely agitated,
      uncertainty of finding what he sought heightening his excitement: for the
      earth showed no disturbance, and since three years had passed since that
      night of Bates in the wood, the object might have been already unearthed.
      After an hour his back was aching, his hands dabbled, his brow beaded,
      while the night-winds blew, the light now was commoved, and now glowed a
      steady red; and still he grovelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, as he shovelled in a circle, always two feet deep, moving the
      light as he moved, he saw on the top of a shovelful of marl&mdash;a twig:
      barkless, black, cracked&mdash;<i>scorched!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      To an immoderate degree this thing agitated him&mdash;some whisper in the
      back of his head&mdash;some half-thought: he began now to root furiously,
      with a frowning intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly he shuddered: a finger seemed to touch his shoulder behind;
      and he twisted with wild eyes, caught up the light, peered, saw no black
      man&mdash;nothing: but quite five minutes he stood defiant, with clenched
      fists; then resumed the work, though with a constant feeling now that he
      was being watched by the unseen seers.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two new strokes he struck upon something hard, and, digging eagerly
      round it, found a quart-can, full of earth. And instantly all doubt
      vanished: for this must have been the beer-can carried by Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong curiosity now wrought in Hogarth, a zeal to lay eyes upon that
      object which had careered through the heights of space to find that
      beech-wood and that elm-tree; and during fifteen minutes his little
      implement digged with the quick-plying movement of a distaff-shuttle, he
      fighting for breath, anon casting a flying wild glance behind, but still
      digging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, frequently, he came upon burned objects, twigs, cinders. Even the
      marl had a scorched look; and his agitation grew to ecstasy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something very singular had happened to his mind with regard to this
      &ldquo;affair&rdquo; of Bates: Bates had said that it had fallen on the asteroid
      night; and O'Hara had told him&mdash;falsely, indeed&mdash;that a piece of
      the asteroid, fallen upon the French coast, had had diamonds; yet,
      somehow, never once had his mind associated the Fred Bates &ldquo;affair&rdquo; with
      the thought of diamonds, but only with the &ldquo;thousand pounds&rdquo; which Bates
      had been promised by old Bond. So at the moment when he had begun to dig,
      his whole thought was of &ldquo;a thousand pounds&rdquo;; but, somehow, by the time
      his implement at last grated against something two feet down, that word
      &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; had grown up in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But diamonds! In the midst of his shovelling the thought flashed through
      him: &ldquo;The world is God's! and to whom He wills He gives it....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now at last the thing lay definitely before him: he grated the spade from
      end to end, scraping away the marl; and it was very rough....
    </p>
    <p>
      The size and shape of a man's leg, and red, anyway in the red
      lantern-shine&mdash;his sight dim&mdash;he moved and saw in an improbable
      dream; and when he tried to lift the object and failed, for a long time he
      sat on the edge of the trench, passing one palm across and across his
      forehead, till the lantern-light leapt, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sprang upright then&mdash;awake, sure: they were diamonds, those bits
      of glass, big celestial ones, not of earth, in hundreds; when he passed
      his hand along the meteorite he felt it leprous, octahedron, dodecahedron,
      large and small: if they were truly diamonds, he divined that their owner
      must be as wealthy as some nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      About three in the morning he managed to raise the meteorite; refilled the
      trench; and since it still rained, rolled the meteorite to the hollow of
      the elm, put on his caftan, and with his back on the interior of the tree,
      his feet on the meteorite, tumbled into a wonderful slumber.

    <h2>
      XXIV. &mdash; FRANKL SEES THE METEORITE
    </h2>
    <p>
      He was awaked by a footstep, and, starting, saw rocking along the forest
      path one Farmer Pollock, wearing now fez and tassel, and he saw his
      clothes all clay, and, with a smile of fondness, saw how, even beneath its
      grime, the meteor dodged and jeered, with frolic leers, in the beams of a
      bright morning that seemed to him the primal morning, a fresh
      wedding-morning, swarming with elves and shell-tinted visions, imps and
      pixy princes, profligate Golcondas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going first to the spot where he had digged, to give to the surface a
      natural look, he trampled the lantern into the mire, threw the tin can
      far, then, taking a quantity of marl, plastered the meteorite, to cover
      its roughness; then boldly left it, starting out with consummate audacity
      for Thring, where everybody, police and all, knew him well.
    </p>
    <p>
      A singular light now in his eyes, an evil pride; and he had the step of a
      Prince in Prettyland. Corresponding to an inward majesty, of which, from
      youth, he had been conscious, he now felt an outward, and had not been
      awake eight minutes when his brain was invaded by plans&mdash;plans of
      debauchery, palaces, orgy, flying beds of ivory arabesqued in
      fan-traceries of sapphire, in which Rebekah Frankl lolled, and smiled; and
      on toward Thring he stepped, prince new-crowned, yet by old heredity, high
      exalted above laws, government, and the entire little muck of Man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one point where the path ran close to Westring-park proper, the park on
      higher ground, a grass-bank seven feet high dividing them, he saw a-top of
      the bank in caftan, priest-cap, and phylacteries, taking snuff&mdash;Baruch
      Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth skipped up, and stood before the Jew, having drawn his face-cloth
      well forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the row?&rdquo; asked Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you give a poor man a job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You a Jew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, replied Hogarth, not dreaming how truly: &ldquo;London born&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Froom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I keep the fasts&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doing about here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tramping&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine mess you are in&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I slept in a hollow tree down yonder&mdash;an elm tree&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's many a worse shake-down than that. Who are you? Ever been
      about here before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was once&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put me in mind of an old chum of mine....Well, here's half-a-crown
      for you to go on with&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make it a crown&rdquo;, said Hogarth, &ldquo;and get me to clean up down there; in a
      shocking state with mast and leaves&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl considered. &ldquo;All right, I don't mind&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall want a spade, and&mdash;a barrow&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down the path yonder, till you come to the stables, and tell them&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl resumed his musing stroll, and Hogarth ran for the barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty minutes he was again at the elm tree, and, with a scheme in him
      for seeing Rebekah, heaped the barrow with refuse, pushed it between a
      beck and the wood, till, wearying of this, he was about to get the
      meteorite into the barrow, when he had the mad thought that Frankl must be
      made to see and touch it, so set off to seek him: and a few yards brought
      him face to face with Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how goes it?&rdquo; asked the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a weight there which I can't lift&rdquo;, said Hogarth. &ldquo;Then you must
      do the other thing. Don't lift it, and you don't get the pay. What weight
      is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is here&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth led him, led him, pointing. Frankl kicked the meteorite.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can't be a branch&rdquo;, said Hogarth; &ldquo;too heavy&mdash;more like a piece
      of old iron&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, slip into it. A strapping fellow like you ought to be able to do
      that bit&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose it's valuable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I make you a present of it, as you are so hard up&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Hogarth, by tilting the barrow, with strong effort of four limbs, got
      the meteorite lodged, while Frankl, his smile lifting the wrinkles above
      his thick moustache, watched the strain: then, with arms behind, went his
      contemplative way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth rolled the barrow toward Thring.

    <h2>
      XXV. &mdash; CHURCH ARCHITECTURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was already eleven o'clock, the sun shining in a bright sky, under
      which the country round the Waveney lay broad to the hills of mist which
      seemed to encompass the valley; yet, when one came to them no hills were
      there, but were still beyond. When Hogarth came out from the wood upon a
      footbridge, to his right a hand-sower was sowing broadcast, with a
      two-handed rhythm, taking seed, as he strode, from his scrip; and to the
      left ran a path between fields to an eminence with a little church on it;
      straight northward some Thring houses visible, and north-east, near the
      river, Lagden Dip orchard. Only two stooping women in fields near Thring
      could Hogarth see; also, still further, a gig-and-horse whose remote
      motion was imperceptible; also the trudging two-handed process of the
      sower nourishing the furrows. But for these, England, supposed to be
      &ldquo;overcrowded&rdquo;, seemed a land once inhabited, but abandoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Hogarth the whole, so familiar, looked uplifted now, the sunlight of a
      more celestial essence. Westring he would buy&mdash;though one memorable
      night in Colmoor he had arrived at the knowledge that it was not just that
      Westring should be anyone's; but then what one bought with his own
      diamonds was surely his own&mdash;his name being Richard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had passed the bridge, when, glancing to the left, he saw a fifth
      person in the landscape&mdash;a man under a sycamore near the church,
      gazing up, with hung jaw, at the apse window&mdash;dressed in a grey
      jacket, but a clerical hat, and he had a note-book, in which he wrote, or
      drew. Hogarth, whose mind was in weathercock state, rolled the barrow to
      the hill, left it, went stealing fleetly up, and gripped the man's collar,
      to whisper: &ldquo;In the King's name I arrest you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man's hand clapped his heart, as he turned a face of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is&mdash;some mistake&mdash;My God! Are you&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have killed me! My heart&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Serves you right. Why didn't you give your right name to Loveday? And
      what are you doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just examining this lovely old church, with its two south aisles,
      and one north, like St. John's at Cirencester. When the church fell in
      England, architecture was abolished&mdash;But as to why I am in Norfolk at
      all, I am skulking: and here is as another place. Your friend packed me
      off to America; but for some reasons I should prefer Golmoor&mdash;old
      Colmoor, eh? I fear I am a voluptuary, my son, fond of comfort, and old
      things, and pretty things. And all that I shall have yet! Tut, O'Hara is
      not done with the world, nor it with him. As to Norfolk, I once knew&mdash;a
      person&mdash;in this neighbourhood&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The priest paused, regarding Hogarth with a smile, the &ldquo;person&rdquo; meant
      being Hogarth's mother; and he said: &ldquo;But you are quite the Jew in dress:
      do you know now, then, that you are of the Chosen Race?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Singular notion! This is a mere disguise&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah. But you look quite radiant. You must have come into a fortune. When I
      heard of your escape, I said to myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, from Harris&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harris is drowned&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harris is now under that little roof down there&mdash;there&rdquo;&mdash;the
      prelate stabbed with his forefinger: &ldquo;Harris is my shadow; Harris is my
      master. He was picked up naked by the ship which ran down your vessel,
      recognized me one day in Broadway, and threatened to give me in charge if
      I did not adopt him 'as my well-beloved son'. Well, from him I heard all,
      how you called fire from Heaven&mdash;it was gallant. But aren't you
      afraid of capture down here in your own country?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot be captured&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those stony eyeballs of O'Hara, bulging from out circular trenches round
      their sockets, surveyed Hogarth, weighing, divining him, while his bottom
      lip, massive as the mouth of Polynesian stone gods, trembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can buy King on throne, Judge on bench, Governor and Warder, the whole
      machinery. Even O'Hara I could buy&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am for sale! Hogarth! I <i>smelled</i> it about you, the myrrh of your
      garments! And didn't I prophesy it to you years ago? What a development!
      That beast, Harris, will dance for joy! Oh, there is something very
      artistic to my fancy, Hogarth, in the metal gold&mdash;brittle, bright,
      orpimented&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And diamonds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth, have you diamonds?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, said Hogarth, smiling at the effect of ecstasy upon O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prismic diamond!&rdquo; cried the prelate: &ldquo;but how&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to enter my service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I <i>want</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want a tutor, O'Hara; and you shall be the man. Undertake, then,
      to teach me all you know in two years, and I'll give you&mdash;how much?&mdash;twenty
      thousand pounds a year&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son&rdquo;, whispered O'Hara, &ldquo;what a development&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye. In Thring Street there is a little paper-shop. Come there
      to-night at seven&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran down the hill: and as he went northward, pushing his barrow, O'Hara
      had a lens at his eyes, saw the meteorite, and wondered.

    <h2>
      XXVI. &mdash; FRANKL AND O'HARA
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sturgess, of the paper-shop, a clean, washed-out old lady, held up
      both averting hands at her back door, as Hogarth threw back his kefie,
      finger on lips; but soon, her alarm warming into welcome, she took him to
      a room above, to listen to his story of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to think&rdquo;, said she, &ldquo;there is the very box your sister, poor thing,
      left with me to keep the day she went away, which never once have I seen
      her dear good face from that day to this. Anyway, <i>there's</i> the box&mdash;&rdquo;
       pointing to a trunk covered with grey goat's-hair, the trunk to which the
      old Hogarth had referred in telling Richard the secret of his birth,
      saying to deaf ears that it contained Richard's &ldquo;papers&rdquo;&mdash;a box
      double-bottomed, on its top the letters &ldquo;P. O.&rdquo;, with a cross-of-Christ
      under them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, sir&rdquo;, said Mrs. Sturgess, &ldquo;you must be in great danger here. I hope&rdquo;&mdash;with
      a titter&mdash;&ldquo;I shan't be implicated&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afraid, Mrs. Sturgess, it will be all right, and, for yourself,
      don't trouble about the paper-shop any more, but buy a little villa near
      Florence, where it is warm for the cough&mdash;don't think me crazy if I
      tell you that I am a very rich man. Now give me a steak&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sturgess served him well that day with a pang of expectancy at her
      heart! Always, she remembered, Richard Hogarth had been strange&mdash;uplifted
      and apart&mdash;a man incalculable, winged, unknown, though walking the
      common ways. He <i>might</i> be a &ldquo;very rich man&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      His meal over, Hogarth threw himself upon a bed, to dream another trouble
      of bubbles and burden of purples; woke at four; and, with a procured
      cold-chisel, hammer, and a calico bag, went to the fowl-house where he had
      left the meteorite, shut himself in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting in the dust there, he set to chisel out the gems from the porous
      ore, and as the chisel won the luscious plums, held them up, glutting his
      gaze, scratched his name on a fragment of window-pane, and was enchanted
      that the adamant rim ripped the glass like rag: the whim, meanwhile,
      working in him to purchase Colmoor, to turn the moor into a paradise, the
      prison into a palace; where his old cell stood in Gallery No. III to be
      the bedroom of Rebekah.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see <i>her</i> that very night was a necessity! and when it was dark he
      set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that plot failed: on presenting himself at the front of the mansion,
      he was sent round to the back, where he received payment, and was
      dismissed; and when he again started for the front, intending to force his
      way in, he decided upon something else, and walked back to Thring.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the Sturgess cottage soon after six, ate, with a candle
      returned to the lean-to to resume his work, and was still intent upon it
      at seven, when Mrs. Sturgess ran out to tell him that &ldquo;the gentleman had
      come&rdquo;. He said: &ldquo;Show him up to my room&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing which O'Hara noticed in that room was the goat-hair trunk,
      with the initials and cross, the initials his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some minutes he furtively turned the key, dived into a mass of
      things, paused to remember the whereabouts of a spring, found it, and,
      lifting the upper bottom, peered beneath; saw a bundle of papers; and,
      without removing the band, ferreted among them, and was satisfied&mdash;-Hogarth's
      &ldquo;birth-papers&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He presently went to a back window, and saw ruddy streaks between the
      boarding of the shanty, while sounds of the hammer reached him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would go and meet Hogarth: no harm in that; but it was stealthily that
      he hurried down the stair and carried himself across the yard, grinning a
      grimace of self-conscious caution, to peep through a cranny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth's back was toward him, the iron leg lying near a box in which was
      a sitting hen, on its top a candlestick, the calico bag, and a lot of the
      gems: at which the priest's palm covered his awed mouth, and with a fleet
      thievishness, like a cat on hot bricks, he trotted back to the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later Hogarth entered, nodding: &ldquo;Ah, O'Hara...&rdquo;; and he called
      down: &ldquo;Mrs. Sturgess! pen, ink, and paper!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When these came, he sat and wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have escaped from prison, and come into great power. I summon you to
      meet me at the elm in the beech-wood to-night at nine. I beseech you, I
      entreat you. I burn to ashes. Rebekah! My flames of fire! I am dying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;R. H.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He enclosed, and handed it, without any address, to O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O'Hara&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;I want you to take that for me. Come&mdash;I will show
      you the place. You ask in the hall to see 'the young lady': her name does
      not concern you; but you can't mistake her: she is so-pretty. Give the
      note to no one else, of course: it mentions my escape, for one thing. I
      know you will do it well&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He conducted O'Hara, till the two towers of Westring were visible; pointed
      them out; then went back, and in an hour had finished his work on the
      diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara, meantime, going on his way alone, muttered: &ldquo;You go fast, Hogarth:
      prelates of the Church your errand boys? But there is a little fellow
      called Alf Harris...if he had seen what I have seen to-night, you would be
      a corpse now&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      In twenty minutes he was at Westring, which he knew well, for twenty-five
      years before he had lived in the Vale: but he supposed that Lord Westring
      de Broom was still the inmate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked to see &ldquo;the young lady&rdquo;, persisted, and after a time Rebekah came
      with eyebrows of inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment O'Hara saw her well, his visage acquired a ghastly ribbed
      fixity. Even before this, <i>she</i>, by one flashed glance, had known
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she took the envelope with easy coolness. And, instead of then
      returning upon her steps, went still beyond, and whispered to two men in
      the hall: &ldquo;Do not let that man pass out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she again returned inward past O'Hara, she remarked: &ldquo;You might wait
      here a little&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She travelled then, not hurrying, down the breadth of a great apartment to
      a side room where her father sat, capped and writing; and she said: &ldquo;Papa,
      the man who assaulted me in the train is now in the hall. As his sentence
      was three years, he must have escaped&mdash;&rdquo; She was gone at once, the
      unaddressed envelope, still unopened, shivering a little in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl leapt up, rather pale, thinking that if the man had come <i>here</i>,
      he must mean mischief; but remembering that the man was a gentleman, a
      priest, he took heart, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara, meantime, stood at bay, guessing his exit blocked, while the
      terrors of death gat hold upon him, the flesh of his yellow jaw shivering.
      But he was a man of stern mind&mdash;stern as the rocky aspect of his
      face, and the moment he saw Frankl coming (he had seen him in the Court),
      he started to meet him&mdash;stooped to the Jew's ear, who shrank
      delicately from contact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't any good in running me down, sir&rdquo;, he whispered in sycophant
      haste. &ldquo;I pledge you my word I came here without knowing to whom. O do,
      now! I have already suffered for my crime; and if you attempt to capture
      me, I do assure you, I strangle you where you stand! Do, now! I only
      brought a letter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frankl, half inclined to tyrannize over misery, and half afraid, swept his
      hand down the beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Letter?&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;from whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a friend&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man named Hogarth&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara said it in an awful whisper, though not aware of any relation
      between Hogarth and Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon an agitation waved down Frankl's beard. The news that &ldquo;a man
      named Hogarth&rdquo; had written to his daughter would hardly have suggested <i>Richard</i>&mdash;safe
      elsewhere; but, one night at Yarmouth, he had seen Richard Hogarth
      inexplicably kiss his daughter's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth?&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;what Christian name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agonized thought in Frankl's brain was this: &ldquo;Well, what's the good of
      prisons, then?&rdquo;&mdash;he, too earnest a financier to read newspaper
      gossip, having heard not a word of the three escapes from Colmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Well, sir, generally speaking, I'm the last to encourage this
      sort of thing; but, as yours is a special case, I tell you plain out that,
      personally, I don't mean a bit of harm to you. Just step into a room here,
      and let us talk the matter quietly over&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He led O'Hara to his study; and there they two remained locked half an
      hour, conferring head to head.

      XXVII. &mdash; THE BAG OF LIGHT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Rebekah, having excused herself from three ladies, her guests, alone in
      her room opened her letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Glanced first at the &ldquo;R. H.&rdquo;, and was not surprised. He had &ldquo;escaped&rdquo;, had
      &ldquo;come into great power&rdquo;: that seemed natural; but he &ldquo;summoned&rdquo; her to
      meet him, and she saw no connection between his &ldquo;great power&rdquo; and his
      right to summon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She held the paper to a fire, and, as it began to burn, in a panic of
      flurry extinguished the edge, and hustled it into her bosom; then
      perambulated; then fell to a chair-edge with staring gaze; then, rocking
      her head which she had dropped upon a little table, moaned: &ldquo;He is
      mad....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My flames of fire! Rebekah! I am dying....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He suffered; and a pussy's wail mewed from her; but with a gasp of anger
      which said &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; she sprang straight, and went ranging, with a stamping
      gait, through the chamber, filling it with passion. &ldquo;I <i>won't go</i>!&rdquo;
       she went with fixed lips, as something within her whispered: &ldquo;You must&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      To escape herself, she went again to see what had happened with regard to
      the convict, whose face would carry to the grave the scars of her nails.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no signs of any disturbance; and she asked a footman: &ldquo;Where is
      the man who was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With your father in the study&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed a strange proceeding: she felt a touch of alarm for her
      father, and, passing again by the study, peeped; could see nothing for the
      key, but heard voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This messenger of Hogarth, she next thought, was a criminal: he might
      betray...so she stole into an adjacent room, to peep by a side door of the
      study, and though a key projecting toward her barred her vision, the
      talkers were near this point, and she could hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The diamond block&rdquo;, O'Hara said, &ldquo;is the same which he rolled across the
      bridge this morning; to that I'll swear&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it must be the very same block he showed me&rdquo;, Frankl said in a
      whisper; &ldquo;that thing was worth millions....!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Undoubtedly it was the same&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but Lord&rdquo;, groaned the Jew in an anguish of self-deprecation, &ldquo;where
      were my <i>eyes</i>? where were my <i>wits</i>? I must have been <i>dreaming</i>!
      No, that's hard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;<i>nil desperandum</i>! Let us be acting, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own land&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are still safe enough: come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He may have lost one or two&mdash;in his excitement. Thousands gone! He
      may have hidden some!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, he has hidden none&rdquo;, said O'Hara; &ldquo;we may have all. Let us make a
      move&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he is a strong man, this Hogarth. Why do you object to the assistance
      of the police?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have the police to do with such a matter? Hogarth would simply
      bribe. And there are three of us&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this Harris?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a Cockney&mdash;assassin&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl took snuff, with busy pats at alternate nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will you tell him is in the bag?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anything&mdash;rings&mdash;something prized by you for sentimental
      reasons. We offer him a thousand&mdash;two thousand pounds. And he will
      not fail. He strikes like lightning&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we share&mdash;how?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come&mdash;let us not talk of that again, sir. What could be more
      generous than my offer? You divide the diamonds into two heaps, and I
      choose one; or I divide, you choose; and, before I leave you, you give me
      a declaration that it was by your contrivance that I escaped prison, and
      that the gems which I have, once yours, are duly made over to me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you collar half!&rdquo; gibed the Jew with an ogle of guile; &ldquo;that's about
      as cool a stroke of business as I've come across. You don't take into
      account that the whole is mine, if the concern fell, as you confess, on my
      own land! And just ask yourself the question: what is to prevent me
      handing you over this minute to the police, and grabbing the lot? Only I'm
      not that sort of man&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara drew a revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You talk to me as though I was a schoolboy, sir&rdquo;, said he sternly. &ldquo;Be
      good enough to learn to respect me. I am not less a man of the world than
      you are, and quite competent to safeguard my own interests. Supposing I
      was weak enough to permit you to send for the police, the moment they had
      me I should tell of Hogarth in hiding; they would go for him, and he,
      after bribing, may be trusted to take wing with the stones, leaving you
      whistling. Or perhaps you would care to tackle him in person? He would
      wheel you by the beard round his arm like a Catherine-wheel, I do assure
      you. All this you see well, and pretend not to. Do let us be honest with
      each other!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't want to be hard&rdquo;, said Frankl, looking sideward and
      downward, plotting behind an unwrinkled brow, intending to have every one
      of the diamonds; so did O'Hara, who already had his plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, don't be hard&rdquo;, said O'Hara: &ldquo;<i>I</i> am not. I give you an
      incalculable fortune; I take the same. Live and let live! Why should two
      shrewd old fellows like you and me be like the dog which, wanting two
      bones, lost the one he had? Come, now&mdash;give me your hand on it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm hanged if you are not right!&rdquo; cried Frankl, looking up with
      discovery: &ldquo;Share and share alike, and shame the devil! That's the kind of
      little man I am, frank, bluff, and stalwart&mdash;Ha! ha! Give me your
      hand on it, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! ha! you are very kind. That is the only way&mdash;absolute sincerity&mdash;&rdquo;
       and they shook hands, hob-nobbing and fraternizing, with laughs and little
      nods, like cronies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop&mdash;I'll just ring for a drop of brandy&mdash;&rdquo; said Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no ringing!&mdash;thanks, thanks, no brandy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are as cautious as they make them. Oh, perfectly right, you
      know&mdash;perfectly right&rdquo;&mdash;he touched O'Hara's chest&mdash;&ldquo;not a
      word to say against that. I am the same kind of man myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come; are you for making a move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed. Where is my hat? I suppose a man may get his hat!&mdash;ha! ha!&mdash;I
      can't very well go in this cap&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You use mine&mdash;with the greatest pleasure. I do not need&mdash;Ah?
      quite the fit, quite the fit&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, so it is. Ha! ha! why, it's a curate's hat, and&mdash;<i>I'm a Jew</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excellent, excellent, ha! ha!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they made merry, and, with the bitter lip-corners of forced merriment,
      went out, while Rebekah, who had caught a great deal of that dialogue,
      crouched a long time there, agitated, uncertain what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      That her father should coolly look on at an assassination for a fortune
      was no revelation to her: she had long despised, yet, with an
      inconsistency due to the tenderness of Jewish family ties, still loved
      him; the notion of appealing to the police, therefore, who might ruin
      Hogarth, too, did not enter her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran and wrote: &ldquo;Your life and bag of gems are <i>at this moment</i> in
      danger&rdquo;; and sent it by a mounted messenger addressed to &ldquo;The Guest at the
      Paper Shop&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in twenty minutes the messenger returned to her with it, Hogarth
      having gone to the <i>rendezvous</i> at the elm&mdash;long before the
      appointed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, accordingly, Frankl, O'Hara, and Harris arrived at the paper-shop
      back yard, and Harris had stolen up the back stairs, he presently, to the
      alarm and delight of the others, sent a whisper from the window: &ldquo;No one
      'ere as I can see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the search for the diamonds was short: for Hogarth had actually left
      the bag containing them on the trunk, and Frankl and O'Hara returned with
      it to Westring, holding it out at arm's length, one with the right, one
      with the left hand, like standard-bearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, meantime, was striding about the elm, and once fell to his knees,
      adoring a vision, and once, at a fancied step, his teeth-edges chattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebekah! He called, groaned, hissed that name, while his to-and-fro
      ranging quickened to a trot.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, fancying that he heard a call &ldquo;<i>Come !</i>&rdquo; he stood startled,
      struck into a twisting enquiry to the four winds; but could not locate the
      call, ran hither and thither, saw no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come to me, little sister&rdquo;, he wailed tenderly, while to swallow was a
      doubtful spasm for him, her name a mountain in his bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was certain that it must be nearer ten than &ldquo;nine&rdquo;, he set out in
      the sway of a turbulent impulse to spurt for the Hall: but as he reached
      the point of proximity between path and park, just there where her father
      had stood that morning he saw her patiently waiting&mdash;ever since that
      &ldquo;<i>Come!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He flew, and was about to skip up the bank, when, with forbidding arm, she
      cried: &ldquo;Don't you approach me!&rdquo;&mdash;and he stood checked and abject, one
      foot planted on the bank, looking up, ready to dart for her in her
      Oriental dress, flimsy, baggy at the girdle, her arms bare, her fingers
      clasped before her, making convex the two tassels of the girdle, from her
      ears depending circles of gold large enough to hoop with, a saffron
      headdress, stuck backward, showing her hair in front, falling upon a shawl
      which sheltered her frank recumbent shoulders. She did not see Hogarth at
      all, but stood averted, implacable, unapproachable, looking across the
      park, while Hogarth occupied a long silence in gazing up to where, like a
      show, she stood, illumined by the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he sent to her the whisper, &ldquo;Did you call just now? Did you say '<i>Come</i>'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want with me, Hogarth? You have '<i>summoned</i>' me: but
      be very quick&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you: I am wealthier than all the princes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me inform you that your life is in danger here; if you are a
      wise man, you will not fail to leave this neighbourhood this night&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But no one knows&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is known, Hogarth: your friends are false, and your enemies crafty.
      You will have to walk with your eyes open, my friend. What will you do
      with all the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will buy the world, because <i>you</i> are in it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she flashed upon him one glance, in which there was astonishment, and
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said that so like my father! Hogarth among the dealers? I thought you
      would be more squeamish, and arduous, and complex&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if a man is famished, he is not complex, he runs to the baker's. You
      can have no conception how I perish! And I cannot be contradicted-I claim
      you-I have the right-I am the lord of this lower world&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you do not see the effect of your words: you disappoint me Richard.
      How of what the poet sings:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  ...this is my favoured lot,
  My exaltation to afflictions high?
</pre>
    <p>
      That is more in your line, you know, but you are dazzled, Hogarth-fie. To
      <i>buy me</i>! And how would you like me afterwards, having renounced my
      obligations? And how would I like <i>you</i>-I whose name is Rebekah, who
      will mate with none but a wrestler, a fellow of heroic muscle? I feel
      certain that you are dazzled. It is natural, I suppose&mdash;But are all
      the people in the world so happy, that <i>you</i> too, can find nothing to
      occupy you but the market-place, with its buying and selling? And to buy
      <i>me</i>? I am <i>not</i> for sale! How dare you, Hogarth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this she walked off; but, having a creepy instinct in her back that
      he was on the point to follow, catch, and snatch her away, she span round
      again, crying: &ldquo;Do not follow me! Mind you! If you like, be at the
      elm-tree again at half-past ten-and I will communicate with you. Goodbye&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now she did not once look back; and he had not heard that fainting
      &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo;, it had fainted so.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself presently in his room at the paper-shop, and lay biting
      the bed-clothes, spasm after spasm traversing his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, turning on his back, he lay with his face now toward the trunk, and
      a little clock ticked ten more minutes before the fact stole into his
      consciousness that the bag was not on the trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time the disappearance was too stupendous to find room in his
      brain. He got up and paced, stunned, just conscious of a feeling of
      unease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he was searching the room mechanically. It was not there....
    </p>
    <p>
      And again he paced, tapping his top teeth with a finger-nail; and now he
      called down the stair: &ldquo;Have you seen, Mrs. Sturgess, the calico bag you
      gave me to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has anyone been in my room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, <i>no</i>, sir! Only myself&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he began to pace, and suddenly the grand reality stabbed his brain
      like a dagger: he was poor....
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara! Where was he....?
    </p>
    <p>
      His forehead dropped upon the mantel-board, and he leant staring downward
      there, a miserable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      But suddenly the man said quietly aloud, raising himself: &ldquo;All right:
      better so. O, I have not been myself&mdash;virtue has gone out of me&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he noticed that it was near the hour of her unexpected <i>rendezvous</i>
      under the elm....
    </p>
    <p>
      And nearly all the way he ran&mdash;wild to see her again&mdash;until he
      neared the tree, when, descrying a female form, he came stooping with
      humility, but soon saw that it was a girl, her head in a shawl, whom he
      did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, coming to meet him, said: &ldquo;What is your name, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am Miss Frankl's messenger&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Hogarth&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you turn this way that I may see your eyes?...All right: Miss Frankl
      directs me to give you these&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who had been weighted down toward the left, handed him an
      envelope, and a steel box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was he so bewildered! On the way home, he observed that the box had
      three knobs of gold, surrounded by rays, and, inlaid in the top, the
      letters &ldquo;R. F.&rdquo;; when he tore open the envelope in his room he found in
      pencil on one half-sheet:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turn the 10 of the right knob to the ray 5; the 5 of the middle knob to
      the ray 0; the 15 of the left knob to the ray 10: and the box will open&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more. When he had set wildly to work, and the lid turned back, his eyes
      beheld the calico bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebekah had, in fact, before setting out to the <i>rendezvous</i> at nine,
      seen her father and O'Hara return to the Hall, bearing the bag between
      them; and, she, crouching at the side door, as before, had heard them
      talk, arranging details. Her father had then said that before he could
      write any document, he must either ring or go search for paper: and
      suddenly she had heard an oath, a thud, a scuffle, had turned the key,
      softly entered, seen the men struggling against the other door, a
      revolver, held by the muzzle, in O'Hara's hand; and before she had been
      sighted by the two desperate men, had had the bag, lying near on an
      escritoire, and was gone. She had then sent some servants to the scene,
      and hurried to her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later she had heard that O'Hara had escaped through a window, and that her
      father was raving below in a sort of fit: for Frankl supposed that O'Hara
      had the jewels, as O'Hara that Frankl had them; and after tending her
      father, she had dashed out to the <i>rendezvous</i>, the jewels then in
      her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hogarth, he did not neglect her warning: and, having left a note
      for O'Hara, telling him where to find him, at Loveday's, took a late train
      southwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      By what marvel Rebekah had become possessed of the jewels he did not even
      seek to fathom; but one of his uppermost feelings was shame for having
      suspected O'Hara of stealing them: and for years could never be got to
      believe in the bad faith of the prelate, his tutor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near midnight, on reaching the obscure townlet of Hadston, he there took a
      bed&mdash;not to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the tiny inn-window he made periodic arrivals, looked out unseeing at a
      cart, a wall of flint and Flemish brick, and a moonlit country, then
      weighed anchor, and swerved away on another voyage; then arrived anew,
      looked out, saw nothing, and weighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked now in the dark of the valley of humiliation, with those words
      written in flame in his brain: &ldquo;This is my favoured lot&mdash;my
      exaltation to afflictions high&rdquo;: he had allowed a woman to say them to
      him, and he went &ldquo;<i>I!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He, the richest of men, was, therefore, that night poorer than any wretch,
      brought right down, naked, exposed to death, and he filled that chamber
      with his moans: &ldquo;God have mercy upon me! a vulgar rich man...a dreadful
      contented clown....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But toward morning he lay calmer, weeping like Peter, and at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being without money, he sent the next day a small stone to Loveday, asking
      him to sell it; also to meet old Tom Bates on the night appointed, and
      keep him till he, Hogarth, came to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days later he received the money in the name of &ldquo;Mr. Beech&rdquo;, but the
      old Bates had not kept the <i>rendezvous</i>; and a month later a
      detective agency discovered that the fisher was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hadston Hogarth remained two months, the most occupied man anywhere,
      yet passing for a lounger in the townlet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here and now he was descended deep into himself, aspiring to greatness,
      set on high designs; and, as the days passed, his thoughts more and more
      took form, though sometimes, with a sudden heart-pang, he would flinch and
      shrink, pierced by a consciousness of the unwieldy thing which he was at;
      and he would mutter: &ldquo;I <i>must</i> be mad&rdquo;. Anon he would start and cower
      at a distinct sound of cannon in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Usually, during the day, he had with him an atlas, a pair of compasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he took train, to see the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another day, happening to look into the goat-hair trunk, he saw that
      account-book, containing the addresses of the signatories to his old
      &ldquo;association&rdquo;, and was overjoyed. &ldquo;Quite a little army&rdquo;, he tenderly said:
      &ldquo;I won't forget them&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two months he left Hadston for London, having in his head a new age
      hatched.

    <h2>
      XXVIII. &mdash; THE LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was night when Hogarth broke into the presence of Loveday at Cheyne
      Gardens with a glad face, crying: &ldquo;Forgive me, my friend, for being a
      boor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are forgiven&rdquo;, Loveday answered with his smile, hastening to meet
      him: &ldquo;the broken picture, you see, is in a better frame, and so are we.
      What could have made us invent a quarrel about&mdash;land, of all things!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, let us talk&rdquo;, said Hogarth: &ldquo;not long&mdash;all about land, and
      sea, too. I suppose you have nothing to tell about my sister? Never mind&mdash;we
      shall find her. Come, sit and give me <i>all</i> your intelligence. You
      are not interested in land, then? You <i>will</i> be in ten minutes&mdash;it
      is interesting. Listen: all the land of the earth is <i>mine</i>, and all
      the sea especially&mdash;a good thing, for, for a hundred years Europe,
      especially England, has wanted a master: the anarchy of our modern life is
      too terrible! it cannot arrange itself; and now the hour has struck,
      though none has heard the bell&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth! but you gabble like a mad god&rdquo;, cried Loveday. &ldquo;I am all in the
      dark&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he spoke, first going into his discovery at Colmoor, frowning upon
      Loveday, ploughing the truth into his brow; proving how modern misery, in
      its complexity, had its cause in one simple old fault, sure as the fact
      that smoke ascends, or apples fall. And when he saw conviction beam in
      Loveday's face, he next told what had happened at the elm-tree, and what
      would happen-soon; whereat Loveday, like a frightened child, clung to his
      arm, and once gasped: &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;my God!&rdquo; and once felt a gory ghost
      raise horror in his hairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour afterwards they were bending over a sheet of paper, Hogarth in his
      shirt-sleeves, writing, Loveday overlooking, suggesting, when two men were
      announced, and in stepped O'Hara with bows and polished hesitations,
      followed by his shadow, Harris; and, &ldquo;Ah, O'Hara...&rdquo; cried Hogarth, still
      writing, &ldquo;who is that with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A friend of mine&rdquo;, said Loveday, for O'Hara had introduced Harris to him,
      and he had adopted Harris as a human study, horrid, but amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment O'Hara saw the face of Hogarth, he started, muttering: &ldquo;He has
      the diamonds back! God! is he a magician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Harris drawled nasally: &ldquo;Of course, you wouldn't know me now, Mr. 76!
      Were there not ten cleansed, but where are the nine, it <i>is</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth was silent&mdash;had not yet decided what to do with Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my tenth call here, Hogarth&rdquo;, said O'Hara, &ldquo;in the hope of seeing
      you, and the streets, you know, are no small risk. You see how I am
      muffled up, and this gentleman, too. By the bye, I have selected a cargo
      of books for you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No study for a month&rdquo;, said Hogarth, &ldquo;but I shall want you all the same.
      Just come over here and watch me write this thing. You, Harris, sit right
      over there&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harris cursed, but obeyed, while O'Hara came and bent under the golden
      glow of the silk shade a brow puckered with a care of puzzlement, as he
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he fell into the work, and was soon the director of it&mdash;invaluable!
      knew everything! remembered forgotten points; explained technicalities;
      the proper person in each little State to whom the document must be
      directed, the style of addressing him. Of one sentence he said: &ldquo;That will
      never do&mdash;lacks formality&rdquo;; and of another: &ldquo;Tut, they will laugh at
      that&mdash;it is provincial and insolent&rdquo;, distracted between the work and
      his brandy glass. At last, about eleven, the three brains had produced a
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth laid claim to the sea as his private property, and warned the
      nations.

      XXIX. &mdash; PRIORITY OF CLAIM
    </h2>
    <p>
      A gentleman&mdash;a Permanent Under-secretary&mdash;stood one noon, his
      back to a fireplace in a bright-carpeted room at the Foreign Office,
      letting his eyes move over some opened letters submitted to him, and
      presently came upon the following document, its crest a flag, containing
      in blue the letters &ldquo;R. F.&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;17 LEADENHALL STR., E.G.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To the Most Hon.,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Marquis of Hallam, K.G.,

    <p>
      &ldquo;Foreign Office,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Westminster, S.W.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;MY LORD MARQUIS:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have the honour hereby to make formal announcement to Your Lordship
      that I am on the point of setting up in the midst of the world a new
      Power, whose relations with the King's Government will, I trust, be
      relations of friendliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my desire that Your Lordship forthwith convey to the King's Most
      Excellent Majesty the announcement which is the subject of this
      Memorandum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My purposes and policy in the establishment of the new Power will
      hereafter appear; and my properly accredited Ministers will, in due
      course, present themselves at the Chancelleries of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hitherto a British subject, it is my will to acquire diplomatic
      recognition&mdash;as soon as such shall comport with the dignity of the
      Great Powers&mdash;as an Independent Sovereign, under the title of: 'Lord
      of the Sea'. (Address: 'Your Lordship's Majesty', or 'My Lord King'.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The domain of my Power will be the sea: and to the sea I hereby set up
      claim as far as such points of latitude as have been attained by Man, and
      over all degrees of longitude. Provided only: that nothing in this claim
      shall be held to infringe upon the prior claim of any nation to a
      'three-mile limit' round its coasts, nor to any national fisheries
      whatsoever, nor to any claim of the Kingdom of Denmark with respect to the
      Sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The validity of my title to the sea must be considered to rest on the
      same basis as the title of any private owner to any area of the earth's
      crust: namely, Priority of Claim. If one is valid, so, necessarily, is the
      other, this title to land, based on <i>Priority of Claim</i>, being
      admitted in the Law of all civilized Nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This my claim will come into operation on this day three years hence.

      &ldquo;I have the honour to subscribe myself

      &ldquo;Your Lordship's

      &ldquo;Obdt. Servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RICHARD HOGARTH &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Under-secretary, a pale, distinguished man, read this letter with a
      little lift of one eyebrow, then let it drop from him into a waste-paper
      basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the German, the Turkish, capitals it met much the same reception.
      Nowhere did it reach the eye of a Departmental Head. It went to Siam, to
      the Prince of Monaco, to Ecuador, and was tossed to cumber a basket, or
      moulder on a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hogarth, who knew that it would be instantly forgotten, had written it
      so as to be able to say that he had written it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time he was lodging in a top room in Bloomsbury, and had an
      underground den in Leadenhall Street, on its doors the words: &ldquo;R. Beech
      &amp; Co.&rdquo; Thither in a brougham he drove daily, lying very low, but
      holding in that den interviews with all sorts and conditions of men, and
      feeling his way toward operations of dimensions so immense, that their
      mere project had a modifying influence upon industry.

    <h2>
      XXX. &mdash; MR. BEECH
    </h2>
    <p>
      During six weeks Hogarth lived that life of daily passage between Keppel
      Street and his office, unknown to the general world, but spreading a noise
      of rumour through certain circles of the business world. All day in the
      den the gas-jets brawled upon him, he not for minutes casting a glance, if
      a clerk brought a caller's name. And here was no novice modesty in the
      tackling of affairs; as O'Hara, who would be there, said: &ldquo;You must have
      been <i>born</i> in the City; you have the airs, the very tricks, of
      Threadneedle Street, you&mdash;Jew&rdquo;. In a day the prelate counted seven
      hundred and thirteen telegrams from the Terni Cannon foundry, many a
      diamond dealer, polisher, cutter, the Vulcan Shipyard of Stettin, the
      Clydebank, Cramp of Philadelphia, the Russian Finance Minister, San
      Francisco, Lloyd's, metal brokers, the Neva, and one night, the eve of a
      dash to Amsterdam, he, with O'Hara, Loveday, and five clerks, sat swotting
      till morning broke, sustained by gin and soda-water. The priest lived with
      wide eyes at the easy fleetness with which Hogarth rolled off him the
      greatest affairs: as when on the day after his return from Holland he
      stood, his thumbs in his waistcoat armholes, with quite the right air of
      serene City-king, his tallness possessing considerable natural
      courtliness, and the De Beers' Secretary sat before him, saying, &ldquo;Well,
      Mr. Beech, I have spent the morning with your brokers, and have felt that
      I must see you personally before calling a meeting. This proposition is so
      tremendous&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wish I had some time&rdquo;, said Hogarth, &ldquo;I would invite you to dine
      upon the matter; but it is really so simple&mdash;everything at bottom is
      merely twice two are four. And you are not obliged to turn over Kimberley
      to me: only, in that case, as I have said, I shall be compelled to flood
      the market with diamonds as cheap as cat's-eyes&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When De Beers stared, Hogarth shrugged, saying: &ldquo;I suppose I must convince
      you&mdash;&rdquo; and, unlocking a safe, he took out an <i>écrin</i> which
      contained three stones. De Beers appeared to see Titania peering in their
      fairy painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of stones of this water and carating&rdquo;, said Hogarth, &ldquo;we have two hundred
      and eleven in the Bank of England, two hundred and thirty-eight in other
      English and Continental banks, and seventy-five in safe-deposit. The
      carating of these three is 111-1/2; and in the sixties, such as this one&rdquo;&mdash;he
      took a stone from among coppers in his pocket&mdash;&ldquo;we have three hundred
      odd on hand, all flawless, and an equal number cutting. When I point out,
      what you know, that our mine is as yet without the delicate plant of
      Kimberley, the stones being simply picked from the blue-earth by three
      inexpert friends of the firm on the spot, you will recognize that the
      wealth of a mine can no further go....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was rid of the visitor within six minutes, and within three weeks, by
      knack and organization, had gathered into his hands most of the reins
      necessary to the control of the world's trade in diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an outer room sat O'Hara, writing, reading Theocritus, or a little book
      on mediaeval embroidery, forefinger on cheek; and anon, absolutely without
      motive, he would rise, creep, and peep through a keyhole at Hogarth, then
      on stalking, bowing tiptoe, grinning a rancid grimace of stealth, get back
      to his seat, and read&mdash;the tutor falling over head and ears in love
      with his pupil: one of those passions that end tragically.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as he so sat, the bell <i>pinged</i>, the door opened, and O'Hara
      jumped to find himself face to face with&mdash;Frankl, who had come to see
      the new diamond king, in the firm belief that Mr. Beech was none other
      than O'Hara; and, &ldquo;I thought as much!&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h</i>&rdquo;, went O'Hara bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;for God's sake! he is <i>in
      there</i>&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Hogarth!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, but&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Outside&mdash;in the passage&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They stepped out; and Frankl, his eyelids red, said: &ldquo;I have only this day
      crawled from bed with the blow you struck my temple, or I should have had
      you before this&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h</i>. Your own fault, sir. <i>You</i> played false first&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Played false with my own diamonds? You hand me over this day one-half
      those stones, or I bring a civil action for the whole, hound you to
      beggary, and drag you back to your convict-cell where you come from&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't lift your voice, I beg of you. Tut, you rave. You can't bring a
      civil action against a great millionaire who doesn't care to defend; and
      as for me, I do assure you, I haven't fifty pounds to-day. <i>It is
      Hogarth who is Mr. Beech!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;Frankl obtruded a startled ear, frowning his eyes
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth. He has the diamonds back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which diamonds? How did he get 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is&mdash;<i>in</i>&mdash;<i>there</i>: better go and ask him! He got
      them by black art&mdash;by the aid of the legion of mediaeval witches
      which wait on him&mdash;<i>God</i> knows how he got them! <i>You</i> gave
      them to him! <i>I</i> gave them to him! but he's got them&mdash;<i>in&mdash;there</i>!
      Better go and ask him&mdash;don't be afraid&mdash;just for the roaring fun
      of it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hogarth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Hogarth, Hogarth&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheated the gallows? And out of prison? And rolling in my wealth, my
      riches, my diamonds? Oh, no!&mdash;is that fair? A dog? Is that how the
      world is run? God of Israel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is this to be said for him: that he <i>deserves</i> to be rich&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? So you are taking his part now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no <i>tut</i> about it! You confess that you are nothing more
      than a penniless hanger-on: well, then, I have <i>you</i>! back to prison
      you go this hour&mdash;-!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara's cheek trembled; but he said: &ldquo;A sufficiently vain threat, sir: I
      am Hogarth's tutor: he won't let me be taken. Don't waste your time, you
      impotent Jew&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tutor? That's good! What you teaching him?&mdash;murder? <i>outrage?</i>
      He <i>ought</i> to have a tutor, he! That's good! Tutor! Well, suppose I
      drop a line first post to your nice <i>pupil</i> to let him know that it
      was his <i>tutor</i> who stole his diamonds&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this threat O'Hara felt himself outflanked; and though his eyes
      surveyed the Jew unflinchingly during a silence, inwardly he had
      succumbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man in Hogarth's situation&rdquo;, he slowly said, &ldquo;is always liable to
      attack. Why should two sharp old fellows like you and me, whose interests
      are identical, quarrel?&rdquo;&mdash;and instantly Frankl took note of that
      surrender, that weak spot, and knew that the man was his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;so true&mdash;two old gaol-birds like you and me, eh? So
      true, so true. But what beats me&mdash;who runs Beech's? Hogarth is only a
      young farmer: he can't operate all the big things I hear about this Mr.
      Beech&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, you do not conceive the man as he is at all&rdquo;, said O'Hara: &ldquo;perhaps
      you cannot. High finance, the first day he looked into it, ceased to
      mystify him, for he goes always to the ground of things, touches bottom,
      where first principles lie, and first principles are simple as two and
      two. It was because he had discovered a first principle that he escaped
      from Colmoor. And he is as nimble as six twisting minnows: what you or I
      learned in a year he learns in an hour, and if he does not know the usual
      way, not an instant does he hesitate to invent a way. You know about
      Owthwaite's: how the recent shake-out of the market threatened their
      collapse, like so many others'. Owthwaite's, in fact, had already
      declared, when Hogarth decided to help them over. And how? Not Bills! He
      filled up a call-in of two millions and a half by the India Council,
      resettled loans and short-discount business, cheapened money, and in
      twelve hours his <i>protégés</i> were off the rocks. And now I hear&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why not buy a chapel, and preach about him? I hate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! O Lord&mdash;he is calling&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's my card; I want to see you to-night at that address at eight&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that night at Frankl's town-house in Hanover Square Jew and prelate
      conferred, O'Hara for some time resisting, but finally again taking sides
      against his saviour. He disclosed that Hogarth, beyond doubt, kept a few
      diamonds in a goat-hair trunk in his room&mdash;enough to make two
      ordinary fortunes, and also carried two or three, with some hundred-pound
      notes on his person; and this was made the basis of a scheme for bringing
      about the arrest of Hogarth, the first step being to get from Hogarth the
      sum he carried about him, leaving him in a situation where he would find
      himself powerless to bribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Frankl undertook; and O'Hara promised to lend Harris, and some
      friends of Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, during these weeks Hogarth was living in some fear, haunted by
      insecurity and a vision of Colmoor; and, remembering the theft at Thring,
      with a consciousness of Frankl somewhere in him, he went not only with
      diamonds on his person, but a revolver as well, and a <i>puñal</i> of
      Toledo.
    </p>
    <p>
      But three evenings after the conference in Hanover Square, he received
      this letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dearest Richard:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is long since we have met. This is to let you know that I have heard
      of your getting out, and your coming into great things, which has made my
      heart rejoice. I, alas, am just the other way about. I am staying for the
      next two days at Woodfield Cottage, Wylie Street, Finchley Road, N. I
      understand that you are lying low, so better not come to see me perhaps,
      but send me something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your loving
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at sight of these words such a whirlwind transacted itself in the
      brain of Hogarth, that he hardly awoke to sense till he found himself in a
      railway compartment, going northward. It was only then that, reading the
      letter again, he started.
    </p>
    <p>
      The handwriting was hers! he was sure. But the words...?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, alas, am <i>just the other way about</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;better not come to me
      perhaps, but <i>send me something</i>&rdquo;. There was a tone here not in
      character. But her handwriting! This was no forgery. If she had written <i>from
      dictation</i> that might explain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this uncertainty he left the train, and took cab, scenting trouble
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulty was to find Wylie Street, which was a half-built street of
      five cottages in a new neighbourhood of brick, and when what was supposed
      to be Wylie Street was discovered, the cab had to stop, for across it lay
      bricks, hods and barrows in mud. So Hogarth alighted, and, peering,
      stumbled forward: no lamp; above, a labouring half-moon riding a sky of
      clouds, like a poor ship riding the bleak morning after a hurricane, her
      masts all gone by the board: and Hogarth could just see that three of the
      five cottages were roofless brick, the fourth unfinished, so the fifth,
      alone on the other side, must be&mdash;&ldquo;Woodfield.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woodfield&rdquo; was unlighted: and the moment he ascertained this, he felt
      himself the victim of a plot; but not all the whispers of prudence could
      hold him now from seeing the adventure through. Loudly he flung back the
      little gate, with rash precipitancy entered: and as he sprang up the three
      steps to ring, he was seized.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were five, three being big fellows, two masked.
    </p>
    <p>
      His main sensation was gladness that none, apparently, was a policeman;
      and he set hilariously to work with his knuckles. This, however, could not
      save, soon he was on his back, striking his head; but when he saw that the
      object was to rifle his pockets, letting be, he managed to steal out the
      <i>puñal</i> from his breast, and presently with a sudden upheaving and
      scattering rage, was staggering to his legs. Before he could be stopped,
      he was making for the gate, but close upon him ran one of the five&mdash;a
      slim man, masked&mdash;who fired Hogarth's own pistol at his legs, but
      missed: whereupon, Hogarth, with a backward twist, struck at random with
      the dagger, which entered the man's breast. But at the same time a whistle
      shrilled, and from an opposite cottage rushed out at last what he dreaded&mdash;three
      policemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      These had been placed there on the understanding that it was thither that
      Hogarth would go, the object of the plot being to rifle his pockets before
      he was officially taken; and it succeeded to the extent that his pockets
      <i>were</i> rifled: but he knocked down one officer, and dodged the other
      two, reaching his taxi; and, having previously arranged with the cabman,
      got off racing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the masked man whom he had struck down was Harris, who for weeks lay
      raving in fever&mdash;an ill-fated stroke, for Harris had a memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Hogarth, he rushed home to Keppel Street, hurried down the trunk,
      and was off to Cheyne Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, he cried, breaking in upon Loveday, &ldquo;this phase of our life is up!
      Look at my clothes: I have had a fight&mdash;Frankl, I suppose. I wanted
      to live a simple life for two years: but they won't let me, you see. Ha!&mdash;then
      the other thing. From this night we bury our identity under mountains of
      splendour. It is disgusting to me, this life, skulking, thinking to bribe
      honest men. Meantime, you must find me some room to hide in with the trunk&mdash;mustn't
      stay here to-night. And to-morrow you buy me a boat to take us off from
      some point of the coast&mdash;Come&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XXXI. &mdash; THE HAMMERS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Within six months Hogarth, as distinct from &ldquo;Beech&rdquo;, had risen upon the
      consciousness of Europe, say like the morning sun: and the wearied worker,
      borne at evening through crowded undergrounds, might read his name with a
      listless incomprehension.
    </p>
    <p>
      He impressed the popular fancy, especially in Paris, where he was best
      known, as erratic: as once when, by a stroke of financial sleight-of-hand,
      he got the young Government of Russia into a tight place, then refused
      them a loan, except on condition of the lease to him of the Kremlin: and
      for three months squalid old Moscow was the most cometary Court anywhere&mdash;acts
      savouring of a meteorite waywardness which impressed him, more than
      anything, upon the everyday world; and he won a tolerant wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, an outcry, led by the <i>Intransigeant</i>, denounced his
      acquisition of the site of royal St. Cloud for his Paris residence on the
      ground that he was a Jew, betrayed by his face&mdash;an accusation which
      caused the buying up of hundreds of thousands of his photographs&mdash;and
      on the ground that his design was to familiarize the people with the idea
      of his sovereignty, and by a <i>coup</i> to seize the Government; at which
      Paris was in a ferment, and a midnight mob traversed the <i>Bois</i> and
      demolished some of his mason-work. The next day, however, the Minister of
      the Interior announced from the Tribune that Hogarth was no Jew, but an
      Englishman <i>pur sang</i>; and, on the whole, Hogarth had his way: the
      noise died down; and where parterres and avenues had stood on the old
      palace site, there arose one of those enchanting fabrics, which, from the
      Bosphorus to London, bore the name of &ldquo;The Beeches&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time he had dependent upon him a retinue, serving him in
      multifarious ways from electrical adviser to spy, and from chancellor to
      recruiter, numbering many hundreds. He knew five thousand faces by sight;
      in England had two armies&mdash;a small one collecting data as to
      acreages, tenures, trades, scales, wages, prices, crimes, mines, and a
      large one, numbering five thousand, doing gun-practice in Westring Vale:
      for, England being for sale, he had bought at thrice its market value that
      part of it called Westring; and on the sea also he kept a little army of a
      thousand, borne in old cruiser-hulks bought from the English Admiralty,
      hulks whose crews, in rotation, changed places with drafts from the
      Westring barracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he disappeared from Europe, and when he returned the President of the
      Republic of Ecuador, thenceforth one of his closest friends, was with him;
      whereupon, through newspapers in the pay of Beech's, the rumour commenced
      to appear that the Ecuador Government was giving orders for coast-defence
      on an unparalleled scale, in view of probable hostilities with Peru.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of which activities O'Hara said to him one morning: &ldquo;You can
      now be called a mathematician&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have many admirers, and but one teacher, O'Hara&rdquo;, Hogarth answered:
      &ldquo;teach me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara cut a secret grimace.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the failure of the Finchley Road plot he had had another repentance,
      and had set himself earnestly to the cultivation of Hogarth's mind; but
      the priest's spirit was not &ldquo;erect&rdquo;; he had &ldquo;falls&rdquo;; maintained a
      correspondence with the Jew, whose eye of malice never slept; and once at
      Cairo, twice in Paris, Hogarth had to use words like these: &ldquo;I must tell
      you, O'Hara, that I have heard of your recent behaviour. Naturally, there
      are those that see for me, and I do not mean to be compromised by your low
      revels&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wretch that I am!&rdquo; broke out O'Hara with smitten brow, and for half a day
      was on his knees in an affliction of self-reproach. Yet the same night he
      wrote a letter to Frankl containing the words: &ldquo;You do not know, <i>you
      cannot dream</i>, the high and slippery road which H. has chosen for his
      feet: the future is <i>big</i> with events. Wait: his sublime path is not
      without pitfalls....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Study with O'Hara was in the morning; at night, when possible, that other
      study of the working world: and often then Hogarth would withdraw from
      opera in the St. Cloud palace, or from some &ldquo;crush&rdquo;, to give an hour to
      the river of statistics with which he was inundated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till these years he had never seen into the sea of things as it is: his
      life so isolated&mdash;had not even read newspapers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he saw and knew. There below him blazed some masque of beauty and
      majesty, moving under a moonlight of blue-darting jets of electric light
      all among colossal columns of alabaster robed in vine and rose; or there
      below some Melba voice, all trembles and maze of wobbly trebles, warbling:
      and the thronged hall sat tranced; but before <i>him</i>&mdash;figures:
      parents killed their children for insurance-money&mdash;keeping children
      in cellars till their flesh grew green, keeping sore the stumps of
      children's legs; with some trades certain comic-sounding names had got to
      be associated, &ldquo;potter's rot&rdquo;, &ldquo;phossy jaw&rdquo;,&mdash;enormous horror; each
      day in England one million people had to seek pauper-relief, many
      perished; of aged persons 40 per cent were permanent paupers; children
      were paid 2-1/2d. for making 144 match-boxes; pretty girls (though pretty
      girls were detestably rare) were allowed to work, nay <i>forced</i> to&mdash;far
      harder than any ten savages ever dreamt of working; in Glasgow 41 of every
      100 families lived in one room: fathers, for weeks, did not see their
      children, except asleep; girls took emetics to vomit up cotton-dust&mdash;enormous
      horror, comic-opera in Hell: and below in the &ldquo;crush&rdquo; the voice of the
      warbler, cooing, shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he would mutter: &ldquo;But that can't be true!&rdquo; There, though, the
      figures lay; and presently he would take heart, and say: &ldquo;Well, not for
      long now, God help me....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whether God helped him or not, certainly Man was helping him: ten thousand
      and ten thousand hammers&mdash;from Spezzia to Belfast&mdash;in
      model-office and mould-loft and rolling-mill&mdash;in foundry and yard and
      roaring forge&mdash;were ringing upon metal for him, their clamorous
      industry clattering over Europe and America carillons of his name.

    <h2>
      XXXII. &mdash; WONDER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Almost suddenly that noise of chiming hammers reached the general ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      First in the German Admiralty was wonder when a spy, engaged as a workman
      at Birkenhead, sent to his Government information that the British
      Government was up to something: something of a novelty so extraordinary,
      that as yet he could form no conception as to its object. That it was
      intended for the sea one must suppose: yet it was evident that nothing of
      such odd draughtsmanship&mdash;of such mastodon proportions&mdash;had ever
      yet taken the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been clever: had penetrated even the model-office, peered at
      detailed draughtsman's-plans, developed from the original specifications,
      as well as at orders for Krupp plates, frames, etc.; had listened in the
      yard to the talk of four naval men acting as a Board of Inspection; was
      able to give details of the machining of enormous processed plates to
      sizes determined by templates, the length of pan-headed rivets, the
      specific gravity of an average cubic foot, the scarfing of edges, the
      accumulation of prepared material. The wooden half-model, he said, was a
      one-ninety-sixth, instead of the usual one-forty-eighth; yet, even so, it
      was 5 ft. 7-1/2 ins. long, as much broad, and 1 ft. 3/4 in. high. This
      meant that the structure would measure 180 yards square&mdash;over
      one-tenth of a mile&mdash;with a depth of 34 yards. Already the
      far-reaching chaos of scaffolding had run up eight yards, with stringers
      and frames to a like level. There were no keel-blocks, for there was no
      keel&mdash;or rather, the keel was a circular plate a yard in diameter,
      resting on a single block, the shape of the structure to be a perfect
      square, along the sides of which four battleships might lie like
      toy-boats: the bottom, from circular keel to upward bend, having the same
      shape as a battleship's seen in midship section, only with four faces
      instead of two. From the knee-bend the sides ran up perpendicular; but at
      the level evidently intended to be the water-line they struck inward, so
      that the flat roof was smaller than the area below; the position of this
      water-line giving a definite clue to the intended displacement; and this
      again showing that the whole&mdash;roof, sides, bottom, and all&mdash;would
      be one wall of Simmons armour&mdash;steeling and backing&mdash;layer on
      layer&mdash;no less than 4ft. 9-1/4 ins. thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this stupendous ark, or citadel&mdash;so simple was its plan&mdash;would
      be turned out in less time than a second-class cruiser; and its cost,
      apart from yard-modifications and groundways, small in proportion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, and much else, the spy reported: but the new fact was obvious as the
      sun; the British and French Intelligence Departments, too, were soon
      conning it; and a week later it was established that, not one, but at
      least eleven, such structures were a-building in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      There went the rumour: &ldquo;It is the Government of Ecuador's order....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was at the end of April; Hogarth, obeying some instinct which
      continually drew him toward Asia, then loitering alone in Trebizond
      tea-gardens and bazaars, buying a braid-bag, mule-trapping, or silver
      sword of the Khurdish cavaliers; while Trinity House gave the alarm that
      if ever the steel monsters, whatever their object, were launched, &ldquo;they
      would constitute, in the absence of proper precautions, a serious danger
      by night to the world's mercantile marine &ldquo;, and while Lloyd's, the
      Maritime Exchanges, the Hydrographic Offices, lived in a species of
      amazement, and were already putting the steel islands into the gazetteers
      and manuals; the newspapers, too, inundated with the views of the public,
      took sides, maintaining, some of them, that it was the part of Governments
      to ascertain the objects of the new works, others that any tampering with
      their progress at this late stage might even mean revolution, so profound
      was their intimacy with industry. Hogarth, meanwhile, having come to El
      Khiff, the camp of the Bedouin pilgrims, there spent some days, and then,
      passing between Jerusalem and Jericho in a caravan of Moabite sheiks, went
      visiting the holy places of Israel, everywhere examining the country,
      especially its agriculture, with great minuteness. It was only on his
      return to Jerusalem that he heard of the agitation in Europe: and at once
      set off Westward from Joppa.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his arrival at Paris toward the end of May the wildest legends,
      originated by him, began to be printed, the most persistent relating to
      the diamond and banking House of Beech, which, it was given out, had
      discovered diamonds within the crust of a Pacific rock-island: the new
      structures, ordered by them, being designed to blast the coast-wall with
      dynamite guns. Cavillers pointed out that diamonds never occur in nature
      in this fashion, and that, even so, it did not need a fort made of armour
      five feet thick to fire off dynamite guns; but so continuously was the
      thing repeated, explained, and puffed, that when the London manager of
      Beech partially admitted it, the most incredulous acquiesced; though at
      the very same period it was proclaimed that the President of the Ecuador
      Republic, Hogarth's friend, had admitted to the Great Powers that the
      forts were to his order (as, in fact, they nominally were); and
      anti-climax was reached when a naval expert, asked to do a hurried article
      for the Times, made some error in calculation, and came out with the
      statement that the fort-things would sink of their own weight. This
      article was headed &ldquo;Beech's Folly&rdquo;; and even when the error was detected,
      the roar of merriment retained its momentum and rolled: so that, to the
      hour of the first launch, the enterprise was commonly referred to as
      &ldquo;Beech's Folly&rdquo;, and scarf-pins, ink-stands, etc., in the shape of the
      forts, were sold with that superscription: &ldquo;Beech's Folly&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, translated into French, became that horrible gallicism: <i>la bêtise
      Biche</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, however, the Ecuador-Beech rage died down the hammers, heard
      for nine days through the turmoil of the world, were again drowned in it.
      The scarf-pins ceased to sell. The 'buses rolled, the Bank cashed notes,
      the long street roared&mdash;and all was as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, in the valley of Westring there was drill and target-practice and
      barrack-life routine, the Westring-eccentricity being associated with the
      millionaire, Hogarth, the island-eccentricity with the House of Beech: and
      in the popular mind Beech and Hogarth were two notions. Islands were
      building in Italy, France, Germany, Russia; in England, Scotland, Ireland;
      at Maine, Baltimore, Newport News: but the Governments, lacking the
      machinery, and also the initiative, and judging to-morrow by yesterday,
      gave no sign from their Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      In June, John Loveday being then at Westring, one morning O'Hara arrived,
      he, too, having left mediæval chasubles to grind at war, and though he no
      longer taught Hogarth, a relation persisted between them; and always not
      far from O'Hara was to be found Harris, living now on the pinnacle of
      dandy bliss, twisting a dandy stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the last night of this visit to Westring that O'Hara at a late
      hour went with stealth and hesitations along a corridor of the Hall, and
      finally tapped at Loveday's door, who, detesting the priest, and reading
      in bed, disgustedly dashed off his cigarette ash, as he called: &ldquo;Come in&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a long time they spoke of things other than the real object of
      O'Hara's visit, till O'Hara said: &ldquo;But&mdash;may I ask you something?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, you are a fellow more in the counsels of Hogarth than another.
      I want to ask you right out frankly&mdash;is it a fact that Hogarth is
      choosing Admirals for the islands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe it is&rdquo;, answered Loveday with his long-bow smile of amusement:
      &ldquo;I already know, for example, that Saltoun will admiral the <i>Homer</i>
      in the Indian Ocean, Vladimir the <i>Ruskin</i> in the Atlantic Crescent,
      and the young Marquis of Erroll the <i>Justice</i> in the Yellow Sea&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I know of. I believe, however, that Hogarth is in the throes of
      decision as to the rest&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence full of Loveday's smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo;, said O'Hara, &ldquo;what I meant is this: you know what I have been to
      Hogarth; without me, what could the poor fellow have done, after all? I
      have taught him to think, to dance, and to dine. Now, then, I ask you
      right out frankly&mdash;am <i>I</i>, my son, in the list of Admirals?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Loveday, flushing, started upright, and sank back. &ldquo;No, I don't fancy that
      your name is among those entertained, O'Hara&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will see about that. Woe to Hogarth, and to his advisers, if he dare
      slight O'Hara, my son! What! after preparing myself with toilsome zeal for
      this post? and after two promises from Hogarth's own lips&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny the promises on Hogarth's behalf&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you! Hogarth looks upon you as a plaything. I do assure you, you are
      not taken seriously, Mr. Loveday. How should such as you know what Hogarth
      promises or designs? &ldquo;&mdash;his cheeks trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, Loveday, smiling again, though pale: &ldquo;Well, if we admit the
      promises...but&mdash;have you accurately acquainted Hogarth with your
      past, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most decidedly, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have not, I think he should know it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your threats do not affect me, sir! In three days I shall be in
      Petersburg with Hogarth, and shall take a pleasure in writing you the name
      of the island to which I am appointed&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In three days I also&mdash;!&rdquo; He stopped: but O'Hara understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the door rushed open, and in looked Harris in under-vest and drawers,
      beneath his arm a bundle of walkingsticks, which he had been caring and
      telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      And &ldquo;'Ere&rdquo;, he drawled, &ldquo;when are you coming to 'ave that bit of cold
      mutton? It's past twelve o'clock as it is&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am coming, boy&rdquo;, said O'Hara, rising with brisk obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, come, why don't you! There were shepherds watching their pretty
      little flocks by night, but to leave a man watching the cold animal is a
      bit out. Come along!&rdquo;&mdash;and O'Hara went.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached Petersburg twelve hours before Loveday, his reason for choosing
      that time being his knowledge that Frankl was in Petersburg, and with him
      Rebekah, Frankl being in a deal with the new-régime Minister of Finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, as O'Hara had been asking himself the agonized question: &ldquo;By what
      absolute <i>finesse</i> can I, <i>just now</i>, win Hogarth?&rdquo; the mere
      presence of Rebekah in the same city with Hogarth drew him thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the next day, when Loveday came, nothing had been done&mdash;no chance
      of <i>tête-a-tête</i> with Hogarth: and that day was O'Hara an anxious and
      tremulous man, living on the tip-toe and <i>qui vive</i> of lynx-eyed
      keenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same night at a masque at the Palace of Peterhof Loveday got a chance
      of dialogue with Hogarth, they seated amid greenery and coloured gleams,
      Hogarth groomed to the glittering glass of his shoes, his legs stretched,
      arm akimbo; and presently Loveday led the talk to things of the sea. &ldquo;What
      an extraordinary activity! The British Government launches the <i>Peleus</i>
      next Monday at Deptford&mdash;the first 28,000-ton war-boat; and seven
      cruisers on the slips. Then the French, Austro-German, Russian&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&mdash;I know. They won't build long&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still the confidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can only ask, my dear boy, because you do not yet see what a thing
      the battleship really is&mdash;much more than half a sham. The march of
      invention is from the complex to the simple: for simplicity is strength;
      but to the moment when I began to construct, naval construction had not
      followed this law: for from the old smooth-bores, aimed with tackle and
      quoin, to the present regime of electric wires, you have had a continual
      advance in complexity&mdash;always within the same little arc of thought&mdash;till
      now the most complex of things is a battleship; and if you ask me which is
      the weaker, a battleship or a watch, I answer a battleship&mdash;<i>weak</i>
      meaning liability to the injuries which they were built to resist. In such
      a case as that of the <i>Maine</i>, sunk at Havana, one might fancy that
      the task of naval constructors is to turn out a thing to sink with a
      minimum of trouble; and you remember the <i>Camperdown</i> and <i>Victoria</i>,
      how, playing about together, one happened to touch the other, when down
      plunged that other. These ships are a compromise between three <i>motifs</i>&mdash;speed,
      resisting attack, and attacking: and the first is so antagonistic to the
      second, and also to the third, that the net result is almost a Nonentity,
      or No-Thing. Nothing, in fact, could be more <i>queer</i>, unfounded, than
      these ships; and the future will look back upon them with pity. Hence the
      simple islands, following the law: and don't think t hat their efficacy is
      a thing riskier than arithmetic itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&rdquo;, went Loveday. &ldquo;But, Richard&mdash;captain your islands with decent
      men&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have something on your mind: what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is&mdash;delicate. Have I your permission to speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, John, yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then&mdash;is O'Hara to be an Admiral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Pat? Hardly, I think. He may. But no&mdash;I don't think. Poor old
      talky-talky. He has worked hard for us, John: and his fund of experience,
      in one way and another, has been invaluable. Well, I don't know: I have
      had the idea, but I don't suppose that, in reality&mdash;Still, I am fond
      of him, John. Such a tongue, and such a versatile brain, is he! He was my
      comfort for many a sombre day in prison&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Listening near with rancid grin behind some greenery, O'Hara kept nodding
      emphatic assents of satisfaction to Hogarth's praise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, stop&rdquo;, said Loveday: &ldquo;do you know why he was in prison?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was innocent&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of stealing some diamonds entrusted him by the Pope&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! he lies. His trial was a <i>cause célèbre</i>, and hence the false
      name he gave me at first: the moment I heard you say 'O'Hara' I knew the
      man. He had committed an assault upon a lady in a train&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beast that he is&rdquo;, went Hogarth, while O'Hara's eyes started from his
      head: &ldquo;and liar, too, it seems. Ha!&mdash;he gave me the most
      circumstantial story. Why didn't you tell me this before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was delicate&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beast that he is. Yet how complex is character! the man's tenderness for
      his Church is so charming&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fiddlesticks! Look here, Richard, I am come all the way from Westring to
      tell you this thing. Don't you give vast powers to that man: it isn't
      decent; and I have a feeling that it will be a baleful piece of weakness.
      And don't get easy, and tolerant, and fat in the eyes, Hogarth. That is a
      very significant Bible-story&mdash;the implacable disaster sent upon old
      Eli for no greater crime than a <i>bonhomme</i> indolence. And in order to
      arouse your wrath against this O'Hara, I am going now, against my will, to
      tell you something: the name of that lady in that train&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Someone whom I know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Loveday's answer hesitated: and in that moment, O'Hara, with
      lightning decision, had his mouth at Hogarth's ear: &ldquo;Come with me quick&mdash;then
      fall down and worship me for a month! <i>Someone is in the Malachite Hall!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Like sudden death Hogarth's colour fled his face; in another instant he
      was a blind, oblivious wight...had known that she was in Petersburg; but
      not that she was at the masque.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment shrubbery, lights, all life, rushed into transformation for
      him: and with an excitement of the eyes, the bloodshot left looking
      bloodier, he went after O'Hara, tossing back at Loveday that fatal saying:
      &ldquo;<i>To-morrow</i>....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A little previously O'Hara, having got from Frankl details of Rebekah's
      dress, had spotted her in primrose silk, black mask and domino, and soon
      with Hogarth refound her in the crush: whereas Hogarth went about
      prospecting over the crowd, with that excitement of his red-veined
      eyeballs, once even entered into talk with a group of four diplomatists,
      but all the time with eyeballs absent in hankering tracking, out prowling
      after one morbid form, as the stallion's prowls after his Sally.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an hour she said in French over her shoulder: &ldquo;Why follow me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he bowed compliance, she added: &ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, and bowed, and she nodded twice, smiling a little, as they
      parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, on the wings of exaltation, made haste to salute the Throne and leave
      the palace, rushing toward solitude to brood upon that smile, those
      familiar nods, and the gentle &ldquo;Are you well?&rdquo;&mdash;in his landau with him
      O'Hara, who persecuted him even to his bedroom; and when, after an hour,
      the priest at last reappeared in a corridor, the night-lights there shone
      upon an exultant visage, like a climber's who, after long clamberings, at
      last stamps on the Matterhorn, and looks abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered his own room, he stood with a hung head, till, sharply
      looking up, he ejaculated with amazed, realization and opening arms:
      &ldquo;Well, it's done!&mdash;I've got it!&rdquo; Now he put forefinger to nose, and
      cut a beastly face at himself in the mirror-wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Hogarth rather guiltily said to Loveday: &ldquo;Well, I have
      promised old O'Hara the <i>Mahomet</i> for the Straits. Don't frown&mdash;I
      owe him something, and the clever beast got over me in crazy moment&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so&rdquo;, Loveday coldly said: and thenceforth, the thing being done,
      was mum as to the name of the lady connected with O'Hara's crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned immediately to England, having there many occupations, which
      multiplied as the islands everywhere neared completion, the first of the
      launches taking place at Spezzia on the 7th of February.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight before this event the Beech-fever had revived, the coming
      launch being no secret, and the doubt whether &ldquo;Beech's Folly&rdquo; might be no
      folly, and the question what, on the whole, Beech's Folly might really
      bode, filled once more the consciousness of the Western world. By the 1st
      of February a drop was recorded in many general securities, in
      &ldquo;governments&rdquo;, rentes, and consols; in Berlin the bank-rate rose one per
      cent.; it was stated that specie was accumulating in European vaults;
      while up leapt futures-cotton in the Liverpool market. At last the First
      Lord of the Treasury, in a speech at Manchester, gave sign of the
      Government's consciousness of the new fact, saying that he could only
      repeat the answer given by the First Lord of the Admiralty to the recent
      Deputations of the Chamber of Shipping and of Merchant Shippers, that
      Britain and the other maritime nations would know how to protect the seas
      from any nuisance. He anticipated no nuisance. The structures popularly
      known as &ldquo;Beech's Folly&rdquo; (prolonged laughter) would be provided with
      lighthouses: and until they proved a nuisance on the ocean's fairways, the
      Governments must permit to private enterprise that free hand which was the
      characteristic of our age; moreover, a recognized Government had avowed
      its association with these structures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the fever heightened. The light-system of the <i>Boodah</i>,
      now included in the usual alphabetical lists of derelicts, was conned by
      thousands of mariners, while in the crowded captains', underwriters', and
      committee rooms at Lloyd's discussion buzzed and speechified in every tone
      of gravity. Suddenly in the F. G. and S. clause marine insurance underwent
      a profound modification; and it was then that the millionaire, Schroeder,
      at that time a German clerk in the City, managed to borrow five thousand
      pounds, and quickly cleared his pile by underwriting on larger F. C. and
      S. terms. And again raged the sale of the islands as penny salt-cellars,
      finger-basins, etc.; in broker's and sub-editor's office the tape-machine
      clicked the hourly progress of preparations at Spezzia; while every
      by-street was dreadful with that music-hall chorus:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;To Spezzia runs the Pullman train;
   The Follies soon their sense will teach;
  We've Beech, O dear, upon the brain,
   He brains upon the beach&rdquo;.
</pre>
    <p>
      Meantime, the question of the drawing-room was &ldquo;Are you going to Spezzia?&rdquo;
       and by the 7th so great a pilgrimage of tourists&mdash;experts, idlers,
      cinematographers, special correspondents, ministers of state, Yankees,
      officers, social stars&mdash;had flocked to the scene, that accommodation
      failed in the town and surrounding hill-country, from Le Grazie on the
      west, to Lerici on the east of the Gulf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning dawned bright&mdash;Italian sky, tranquil Italian sea&mdash;and
      by nine the harbour was alive with small-craft and Portovenere steamboats,
      all gala with flags; on the land side, too, over the hills, up the old
      road called Giro della Foce, and before the villages commanding the town,
      spread a cloud of witnesses; while the multitude in possession of <i>permessos</i>
      for the dock-region stretched across a hundred and sixty acres, perched on
      every coign, and murmuring like the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all in the air a fluttered consciousness of the to-come, the present
      nothing, an hour hence everything&mdash;like the suspense of nature before
      gales, and that greatness and novelty of marriage-mornings: for such a
      bride that day would rush to the brine as it had never embraced.
    </p>
    <p>
      There lay the hulk, all nuptial in colours, her roof looking like a <i>plaza</i>
      of Lima or La Paz at Carnival, flags in mountain-ridges round her edges,
      flags in festoons, in slanting clothes-lines, in trophy-groups, on
      bandroled poles, bedecking her; some scaffolding still round her; and
      three running derricks, capable of wielding guns and boilers of 140 tons,
      craned their shears about her. A temporary stair under flags ran right up
      to a ledge above the waterline: from which ledge little steel steps led
      here and there to the roof; round the edge of roof and ledge running two
      balustrades, surrounding the hulk; and over that upper portion, four times
      repeated in white letters ten feet high, the name <i>BOODAH</i> boomed
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      By eleven some seven hundred people stood and sat on the roof&mdash;the <i>élite</i>
      of Europe, invited to the luncheon after the launch, seeming to the tract
      of on-lookers quite dainty and visionary there, like objects mirrored in
      an eye. And they formed groups, of which some chatted, and were elegant,
      and some spoke the gravest words uttered for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, really, is the <i>Boodah</i>?&rdquo; asked a Servian Minister of a
      French: &ldquo;is she a whim, a threat, or a tool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is too heavy for a whim&rdquo;, answered the French, &ldquo;too dear for a
      threat, and too fantastic for a tool. Time will show&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was no answer at all: something more to the point came from a
      multitudinous tumult of sledges below&mdash;the workmen &ldquo;wedging-up&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, soon after noon, Hogarth, with a considerable following, was seen
      ascending the steps, on his arm the Queen of the Ceremony&mdash;a little
      Bavarian Gräfin, famous for her face: he, princely now with that
      cosmopolitan polish picked up in Courts, bending above her with laughter,
      making her laugh also, as they paced up. And at once the invited,
      including the Board of Verification, entered the hull upon a tour of
      sight-seeing, conducted by a manager of the contractors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the set-up wedges had raised the <i>Boodah</i> from her
      keel-block, and left her resting on the great braced ground-ways; and now
      down to the sea's brink the greasers were busy, prodigals in tallow,
      while, within, the seven hundred trooped from spectacle to spectacle, like
      a tourist group guided through the Louvre.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour, and they anew appeared on the roof, trooping toward that
      balustrade that faced the sea: upon which the throngs felt the impending
      of the event, and intently watched. But there seemed no hurry, Hogarth all
      gay chatter, anon lowering the lids a moment, as he looked over the water;
      till suddenly hundreds of glasses detected a champagne-bottle with ribbons
      in the christener's hand; and the consciousness of the moment come moved
      the hosts when Hogarth, even as he chatted, disengaged a flag, and let it
      fall: it was a signal; down it fluttered; and instantly, down there,
      bustle broke loose, as the call &ldquo;Saw-off!&rdquo; went forth, and the saws set
      flurriedly to fret through the timbers which bind groundways to
      slidingways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Now?</i>&rdquo; whispered Hogarth at the christener's ear: and, even as he
      spoke, the voice of a noising arose and droned from Spezzia, its hills,
      its villages, and its sea; the <i>Boodah</i>, only half-liberated,
      strained in travail; crashed from her bands; slipped down the greased
      gradient&mdash;plunged&mdash;and, gathering momentous way, went wading
      deep, deeper&mdash;like Behemoth run mad&mdash;amid a wrath of froths and
      a brawling of waters, into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, deep-planted, she stretched: on the surface appeared a reef of
      steel; and the stirred-up water slapped vapidly upon those flanks, like
      waters upon the Norway wall.

    <h2>
      XXXIII. &mdash; REEFS OF STEEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nothing was ever so scrutinized as the movements of the <i>Boodah</i>
      during the next two months.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning three weeks after her launch three steamers took her in tow,
      with progress so slow, that at nightfall they were still visible from
      land; but the next morning had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later they were met on the Genoa-Leghorn <i>route</i>, six
      steamers then towing the <i>Boodah</i>, their course S. by W.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again and again it was met, that funeral of the sea: the prone, tearing
      steamers, the reluctant bulk. Sometimes a captain's glass might make out a
      few men lost on the roof like men on a raft, smoking, seated, leaning over
      a balustrade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Southward and westward it swam. On the seventh day there arrived at
      Ajaccio from Marseilles twenty-five bluejackets; and these, in a hired <i>speronare</i>,
      put to sea, and joined the <i>Boodah</i> twenty miles from the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thenceforth, a smoke would be seen at a point of the roof, indicating that
      she, too, was steaming: for it was known that she had a screw and a
      rudder; and so closely was she observed, that her now added rate could be
      fixed&mdash;two to three knots a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      She must therefore have some small engines about 4,000 H. P.: and since
      their <i>motif</i> could only be one thing, resistance to ocean currents,
      this meant that the <i>Boodah</i> was intended to rest always in one spot:
      a startling conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally a Surveying Service warship would peep above the horizon,
      watching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she passed through the Straits, seventy-five English blue-jackets put
      out from Trafalgar, and joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such reports passed the weeks. Occasionally five or six coal-ships
      would be seen about the <i>Boodah</i>; her number of tug-ships might be as
      low as two; sometimes nine, ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night she made a fine display, and homeward-bound boats from Cape Horn,
      from Pernambuco, Para, Madeira, spoke highly of her two revolving-drum
      lighthouses: for these, from opposite corners of the roof, at the rate of
      a revolution per minute, poured into space two shimmering comets, like
      Calais and the Eddystone&mdash;rapt spinning-dervishes of the sea that
      hold far converse with the dark, till morning. And between these two ran a
      festoon of electric lanterns, Japanese and Moorish, cut in ogives; and
      festoons of coloured moons drooped round the balustrades, so that the
      blaze and complexity of it presented to ships a spectacle of speckled
      mystery, fresh to the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      After five weeks a hundred and seventeen blue-jackets put out from
      Portsmouth in a chartered barque and joined her, she still in tow, making
      now about N. by W.
    </p>
    <p>
      But by the time this news reached Europe the eyes of Europe were no longer
      given up to the <i>Boodah</i>: for <i>another Boodah</i>, called the <i>Truth</i>,
      was a-tow through the North Channel from Belfast; and she had not reached
      the Mull of Cantire, when a third was launched at San Francisco, so that
      the interest of the islands became complicated.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would they do? What could they? Compared with this question, the
      riddle of the Sphinx was simple, the supposition that they were going to
      batter coast-walls in the S. Pacific being hardly now tenable. The <i>Boodah</i>
      finally came to rest some miles North of lat. 50° and East of long. 20°:
      and there&mdash;just on the northern rim of the Gulf Stream where it
      divides, part toward Ireland, and part toward Africa&mdash;she remained,
      precisely in the middle of the trade-route between Europe and Boston, New
      York, Halifax: a <i>route</i> covered for fifty miles&mdash;twenty-five
      north, twenty-five south&mdash;by her 19.5-inch guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to describe with how wild a heart, or thrilling a boding,
      the world heard this thing: eight days later the International Conference
      of Maritime Nations met at The Hague.
    </p>
    <p>
      But nothing happened&mdash;or the opposite of what was feared: for, as
      months passed, the <i>Boodah</i>, planted there in the ocean, rapidly
      became the recognized gathering-point of the fashion and gaiety of Europe,
      thither flocking the socially ambitious and the &ldquo;arrived&rdquo; together, and to
      have been invited to those revels of taste and elegance became a
      superiority. Gradually, as the names &ldquo;Beech&rdquo;, &ldquo;Ecuador&rdquo;, ceased to be
      associated with the islands, the name of Hogarth took their place; and
      Hogarth had engaged Wanda, sweetest of tenors, to a year's stay in the <i>Boodah</i>,
      whose orchestra was the most cultured anywhere; Roche, her <i>chef</i>,
      had two years previously been put into a laboratory to devote his soul to
      the enlargement of his art; and he and that tenor lived in suites of the
      <i>Boodah</i> such as most princes would consider Utopian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly anything in her interior suggested <i>the ship</i>: no hammocks for
      marines, rolling-racks, sick-bay, lockers, steam-tables, wash-rooms, she
      being just a palace planted in the Atlantic, her bottom going down to a
      layer of comparative calm, so that hardly ever, in a storm, when the ocean
      robed her sides in white, washed abroad her slippery plateau, and drenched
      with spray her lighthouse tops, did the ballroom below know shock or
      motion. Into her principal hall, far down, circular, one descended by a
      circle of steps of marble, round which stood a colonnade of Cuban cedar,
      supporting candelabra and silks; and from atrium-pools sunk in the floor
      twelve twining fountains brandished spiral sprays, the floor being of a
      glassy marble, polished with snakestone, suffused with blushes at the
      coloured silks and at a roof gross with rose and pomegranates, hanging
      chandeliers; round the raised centre of the floor stood two balustrades,
      three feet high, hung with silks, the inner circle thirty feet across,
      higher than the outer, forty-five across: a roseate room, strewn with
      cushions, colours, flushes; but that raised space was empty: reserved for&mdash;a
      throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throne, still unfinished, had been three years making in India.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during nine months the <i>élite</i> and joyous yachts arrived, not at
      the <i>Boodah</i> only, but at others of the twelve which, one by one,
      were launched and towed to position; and a round of events transacted
      themselves in the fortresses: Marie Antoinette balls, classic concerts,
      theatrical functions by <i>troupe</i> or amateur, costume-balls,
      children's-balls, banquets of the gods, grave receptions. By now there ran
      right across the <i>Boodah's</i> roof, in the form of a cross, two double
      colonnades of Doric pillars, at the four ends being Roman arches: and
      here, some summer afternoon, the passing ship would see a bazaar, all
      butterfly flutter, feminine hues like flower-beds, cubes of coloured ice,
      flags, and a buzz of gaiety, and strains of Tzigany music&mdash;rainbow-tints
      of Venice mixed with the levity of the Andrássy Ut of Pesth. Sometimes a
      fleet of craft would surround the islands. Besides, to each was attached a
      yacht, and a trawler which continually plied for it between island and
      land.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Hogarth was deep in debt, and Beech's living upon credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, gradually, a good deal of the awe which the structures had inspired
      passed off. On the whole, they seemed mere whimsical castles-of-pleasure.
      The trains of industrious ships grew habituated to their gaudy brightness
      by night, to their seething reefs, or placid mass, by day. On foggy days
      the mariner was aware of the islands wailing weird siren-sounds of
      warning. The islands waved common-code signals of greeting to the passer.
      Trinity House sent them the usual blanks and instruments for recording
      meteorological observations. Their positions were marked in British
      Admiralty Charts, in American Pilot Charts, in &ldquo;Sailing Directions&rdquo;. The
      great greyhounds, racing to Sandy Hook, raved with jest past them. The
      islands began to seem a natural part of the sum of things. There they lay,
      stable, rooted, trite, familiar; and the question almost arose: &ldquo;How came
      it that they were never there <i>before?</i>&rdquo;&mdash;just that object, of
      that form and colour, seemed so old and natural in that particular spot.
      So the frogs hopped finally upon the log that God sent them for sovereign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the more thoughtful of men did not fail to observe, and never
      forgot, that no ship could possibly depart from, or arrive at Europe,
      without passing within range of some one of the islands' guns. A row of
      eight lay an irregular crescent (its convexity facing Europe) from just
      outside the Straits of Gibraltar, where O'Hara admiraled the <i>Mahomet</i>,
      to the 55th of latitude, where the <i>Goethe</i> lay on the Quebec-Glasgow
      <i>route</i>: these commanding the European trade with the States and with
      S. America, as well as with W. and S. Africa, and with Australia by Cape
      Horn; another in the narrows of the Gulf of Aden, commanding the world's
      traffic by Suez with the East and with S. Africa; another in the middle of
      the narrows of the Kattegat, commanding all Baltic trade; another, fifteen
      miles from San Francisco, and another a hundred and fifty miles from
      Nagasaki, on the edge of the Black Stream, commanding the Japanese-San
      Francisco, the Australian-San Francisco trades, and great part of the
      Japano-Russo-Chinese. These were the principal trades of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like the despair of Samson awaking manacled and shaven, an occasional
      shriek would go up from some lone thinker, who perceived that the kingdoms
      of the world had lapsed into a single hand; and in the privy cabinet the
      governors drank to the dregs the cup of trembling. But their speech was
      bold, the matter hung long, the peoples ignored and wrought: there was
      seed-time and harvest; the newsboy brawled; the long street roared. Far
      yonder in the darkness and distance of the deep the islands flashed and
      danced, and were fashionable.
    </p>

    <h2>
      XXXIV. &mdash; THE &ldquo;KAISER&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      It was the habit of Hogarth, when in the <i>Boodah</i>, to rise very early
      and ascend in flannels to one of the four doors opening upon the ledge&mdash;blocks
      five feet thick, moved by hydraulic motors&mdash;and sometimes Loveday
      would accompany these walks, they always seeing on the plane of the sea
      some sail, or by a spyglass the fading light-beam of the <i>Goethe</i>
      north, of the <i>Solon</i> south; or they watched how the <i>Boodah's</i>
      galaxy, too, waxed faint and garish as some drama of colour evolved in the
      East; saw gulls hover and swing, fins wander: and marking that simple
      ampleness of the plan of sea and arch of heaven, their hearts felt
      enlargement.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, the 3rd October, Loveday was up even before Hogarth, having
      started awake from a gory nightmare, this altogether not being a day like
      others: and when the two friends met on the ledge, they walked a long time
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only after the dayspring began definitely to dabble in its chromatic
      chemistries Loveday at last remarked: &ldquo;Did you ever think why I took such
      pains to get you to come down with me to Lord Woolacot's last autumn two
      years?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, answered Hogarth: &ldquo;you wanted me to see the model farms, and how
      the young ladies fed the poor, and how the tenants loved their lord, and
      everyone thought himself happy. Only, I didn't see what the pastimes of
      Lord Woolacot's daughters have to do with the process of the suns, and
      with the woe of Oldham. Ah, Lord, it is a job, I tell you, pulling this
      vile thing straight! Of course, the eagle doesn't blink: but I am only one
      man, and the world, and its stupid sins, are a tidy burden. Ha!&mdash;never
      mind. Look at that big <i>Boodah</i> of a sun how he blooms: isn't he
      launched and handled all right? Let us of this desert bend the knee to him
      like the old Sabæans. There is hope&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was known that on that day, at half-past eleven A.M., the <i>Kaiser
      Wilhelm der Grösste</i> would pass on her second voyage within some miles
      of the <i>Boodah</i>, this ship being the greatest afloat, having a
      cargo-carrying deadweight of 45,000 tons, and travelling the waters like a
      railway-train at 37 miles (32 knots).
    </p>
    <p>
      So toward noon Hogarth, in a peaked cap, jacket, and white boots, was
      again on the roof, a glass and book of Costonlights in his hand, while not
      far off a knot of five officers in frockcoats talked, and near one
      light-house, where a number of men stood, a flagstaff flew the ensign&mdash;blue
      letters &ldquo;R. F.&rdquo; on a white ground, looking Russian; on the northern
      horizon two fox-tails of smoke; on the western three diminutive sails;
      between the two, quite real and big, a brig becalmed; and now the <i>Kaiser
      Wilhelm</i>: for that yonder could be only she, with so fervent a growth,
      from the first moment of her upward climb, did she approach. It was twenty
      minutes to noon, and she was somehow a little late, that punctual strong
      wrestler with space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officers on the <i>Boodah</i> spoke of her in low and stealthy voices;
      looked at her with queer and stealthy glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'As a bird to the snare...'&rdquo; muttered one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She comes all right, but will never go&rdquo;, said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will be always near us&rdquo;, said a third.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Life is an earnest thing, after all&rdquo;, said a fourth: &ldquo;there are wrongs,
      it seems, which only blood can wash out: it comes to that at last&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Loveday ran up, looking scared and busy, a quill behind his ear,
      Hogarth now having the glass at his face, while his eyes struggled with
      the reek from his cigar-end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that she?&rdquo; Loveday asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, poor boat&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was nine miles away; in four minutes she was less than seven, and now
      distinct:&mdash;her three staysails; her four funnels; the stretched-out
      space between her raked masts; her host of cowls and boats; her high
      victorious hull, silently running.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all along her lines were lines of faces thick as dahlia-rows in June&mdash;globe-trotters;
      captains of industry; children; the Wall Street operator who plotted a
      stroke in Black-Sea wool, and to him time was money&mdash;I guess;
      commercial travellers, all-modern, spinning, prone, to whom the sea was an
      insignificant and conquered thing; engineers; capped enthusiastic Germans,
      going forth to conquer; publishers, ladies, lords, all the nondescript
      prosperous: and all ran there blithe, sublime, and long drawn-out; and
      they toyed with oranges, nuts; and they looked abroad to see the <i>Boodah</i>&mdash;ship's-surgeons
      and officers with them&mdash;jesting, as they munched or sucked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Captain who had often seen the <i>Boodah</i>, was log-writing in
      the chart-room...
    </p>
    <p>
      As her ensign of greeting ran up her main, her clocks struck twelve, the
      full noon&mdash;like an omen&mdash;come; she not then three miles from the
      <i>Boodah</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And simultaneously with the hoisting of that ensign, and the striking of
      those clocks, the old-worn wheels of Roman Civilization stopped dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Boodah</i> ran up the signal: &ldquo;<i>Stop!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those who understood rubbed their eyes: it was like a vision at high noon;
      they could not believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that news the Captain, a handsome fair-bearded man, rushed like a
      madman from pilot-house to bridge, and the startled passengers saw his
      lighted eyes. He had some moments of indecision; then down he, too, rang
      that word: &ldquo;<i>Stop</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The engines left off; the <i>Kaiser's</i> speed, as from heart-failure,
      gave in, died away.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time all the passengers knew, in a state of tremor saw confused
      runnings to and fro, and face caught from face dismay; the voyage was
      spoiled, the record! What, then, had happened to the world? And now again
      the <i>Boodah</i> is signalling: &ldquo;<i>Let the Captain come</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain's hands were shaking; he could not speak, could only gasp to
      the first-officer: &ldquo;By God, no; O, by God, no&rdquo;. Then, as great quantities
      of black-grey reek, wheeling all convolved, were now enveloping the
      vessel, resting on the sea, reaching away in thinner fog even to the <i>Boodah</i>,
      and as, the day being calm, there was a difficulty in reading the flags,
      the Captain gasped: &ldquo;Take the trumpet&mdash;ask them&mdash;But don't they
      pay for this...?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So out brayed the trumpeted query, and back the inexorable trumpeted
      answer: &ldquo;<i>Let the Captain come</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, then, the <i>Kaiser</i> would never reach Sandy Hook? To put out
      boats!&mdash;to parley!&mdash;while the earth span with quick-panting
      throbs, every second worth seven thousand pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't they <i>pay</i> for it...?&rdquo; so, with a painful face of care,
      the Captain questioned space.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would be mild and patient as a lamb that day! His order went forth:
      the ship forged ahead; a longboat, hurriedly lowered to starboard, was
      manned for the first-officer to put off in her, while every heart of the
      passengers thumped, every face an ecstasy of emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then a wretched, long interval...
    </p>
    <p>
      The ship's-officers were received on the <i>Boodah</i> in a deck-room
      containing a number of boats with castored keels, capable of being quickly
      launched down an incline, where Mr. F. Quilter-Beckett, the Admiral, with
      some lieutenants, awaited them at a bureau on which lay documents, while
      in the background stood Hogarth and Loveday, and, &ldquo;Gentlemen, this is a
      most damned wild piece of madness!&rdquo; broke out wrathfully the
      first-officer, as he dashed up wild-eyed to the level: &ldquo;in consideration
      of the guns you have in this thing&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your Captain?&rdquo; asked Quilter-Beckett, a courtly man, with a
      dark-curling beard, a star on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Captain won't come!&rdquo; whined the officer in perfect English: &ldquo;I
      suppose you realize the terrible consequences of this stoppage,
      gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are wasting time, sir. You represent your Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I represent&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then just cast your eye over this&rdquo;&mdash;that so slighted letter, sent
      years before by Hogarth to Foreign Offices, claiming the sea as his
      private manor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer read it half through with flurried closeness; then, &ldquo;Well, but
      what is all this?&rdquo; he broke out: &ldquo;is it a piece of comedy, or what,
      gentlemen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is serious; and the last clause comes into operation to-day: only such
      ships being held authorized to pass on the sea as pay to the first-reached
      sea-fort on any voyage a tax, or sea-rent, of 4s. per ton on their
      registered tonnage, with an additional stamp-tax of 33s. 4d. for receipt,
      and a stamp-tax of £1 16s. 8d. for clearance. You will see at a glance the
      clauses of the law, if you cast your eyes over this schedule&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Law!&rdquo; the other broke in: &ldquo;you talk of <i>Law</i>! But doesn't the sea,
      then, belong by right to all men&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not more than the land. Ask yourself: why should it? But I do hope you
      won't argue: your time must be so precious&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out shrilled the <i>Kaiser Wilhelm's</i> whistle of recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must go!&rdquo; said the officer with a worried hand-toss: &ldquo;I must go. If you
      give me those documents, I will show them to the Captain&mdash;but he is
      not the sort of man&mdash;this is mere piracy, after all! But, good God,
      gentlemen, if you only dare touch that ship, I shouldn't put myself in
      your place this day week for all&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He snatched the papers, dashed, and his men, in a passion of haste, lay to
      the oars, the <i>Kaiser</i> only four hundred yards from the <i>Boodah</i>;
      and the officer, shaking aloft the documents, pitched up the stair, the
      centre of five hundred pairs of scared eyes, while the captain bored his
      way to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes of intense low speech, crowded with gestures: and suddenly the
      Captain's face, till now haggard, reddened; out went his shaken fist; with
      eyes blazing like lunacy, up he flew to the bridge; and now he is bending
      down with howling throat: &ldquo;Passengers to their berths!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Simultaneously, above the engine-room stair a bell jangled; round swung
      the pointer to &ldquo;<i>Full Ahead</i>&rdquo;; and ere the decks were cleared of
      their bustle the <i>Kaiser</i>, like a back-kicking hen, scratched up
      under her poop a spreading pool of spume, which tossed spasmodic
      spray-showers and spoutings: and she stirred, stretched like a street,
      churned the sea, and, wheeling to reveal her receding stern, was away.
    </p>
    <p>
      By which time Hogarth was standing at a cubical cabin of steel on the
      roof, with him Loveday and Quilter-Beckett, his brow puckered with
      wrinkles, the sun troubling his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose the <i>chef</i> is warned?&rdquo;&mdash;he threw away his cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, my Lord King&rdquo;, Quilter-Beckett answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Loveday: &ldquo;She sweats like a thoroughbred&rdquo;&mdash;haggard, but assuming
      calm: &ldquo;few things could be more profusely expeditious&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, make phrases, John,&rdquo; murmured Hogarth.... &ldquo;Well, but hadn't you better
      be getting out the boats?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Quilter-Beckett stepped into the little erection, touched a
      button, and in a minute the water round the southern side was swarming
      with twenty-three boats whose blue-jackets began to row toward the <i>Kaiser</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      And presently, &ldquo;It's no use waiting&rdquo;, said Hogarth, looking in upon
      Quilter-Beckett: &ldquo;I should mine and shell her at the same moment, if I
      were you; tell them to get it in well amidships&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now a few seconds, full of expectation, passed, the <i>Kaiser Wilhelm</i>
      already two miles away: till suddenly space opened its throat in a gulf to
      bay gruff and hollow like hell-gate dogs; and, almost at the same moment,
      close by the <i>Kaiser</i> a column of water hopped with one humph of
      venom two hundred feet on high: when this dropped back broad-showering
      with it came showering a rain of wreckage; and instantly a shriek of
      lamentation floated over the sea, mixed with another shriek of steam.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment the ship, enveloped in vapours, could not be seen; but in
      two minutes glimpses of her hull appeared, shewing the bluff bulge of her
      starboard bottom: for she leaned steeply to port with a forward crank, her
      two starboard screws, now free, spinning asleep like humming-tops. A
      six-inch shell, beautifully aimed, had shattered her engines, killing two
      stokers, and a torpedo-mine had knocked a hole nine feet across in her
      port beam.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the <i>Boodah's</i> boats, meanwhile, had been racing toward her,
      and as her own port boats were quickly out, all were got off; in fact, she
      floated so long, that her ship's papers with £270,000 in specie, and a few
      hundred-weight of mailbags were saved, and even after the boats reached
      the <i>Boodah</i> she still stretched there motionless, until, with a
      sudden flurry, she determined to plunge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards Hogarth had the Captain in his suite, to tell him that he
      did not wish any intelligence of the event to reach the world for four
      days, during which passengers and crew would be his guests, and then be
      sent on to America, his object, he said, being to impress the loss of the
      <i>Kaiser</i> upon the consciousness of all, by making all anxious as to
      her fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that night her passengers danced till late, for there was no resisting
      the hospitality of Hogarth, or the witchery of those vistas and arcades,
      grand hall and lost grot, <i>salons</i> and conservatories, there in the
      dark of the ocean, or such an enchantment of music, and fabulousness of
      table; the host, too, pleaded prettily for himself; and now they pardoned,
      and now they pouted, but always they banqueted, kissed, lost themselves in
      visions, were charmed, and danced.

    <h2>
      XXXV. &mdash; THE CUP OF TREMBLING
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was by the merest chance that Baruch Frankl and his daughter were not
      on the <i>Kaiser</i>: for Frankl was the half-nephew of Mrs. Charles P.
      Stickney, a New York Jewess, and as the marriage of Miss Stickney with
      Lord Alfred Cowern was only fifteen days off, Frankl had made arrangements
      to accompany the bridegroom across, but had been detained by stress of
      business; happily for him&mdash;for Lord Alfred, the bridegroom, was a
      dancing prisoner in the <i>Boodah</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early, then, on the third morning thence, Charles P. Stickney, the bride's
      father, a natty little Yankee, hurried a-foot to the Maritime Exchange:
      for, to his infinite surprise, the <i>Kaiser's</i> arrival had not been in
      the morning's paper: so the little arch-millionaire stepped toward Beaver
      Street, sure that the <i>Kaiser</i> had come in too late for the press.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early as it was, he found the place as thickly a-buzz as though it was
      that feverish hour between eleven and twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed his way to the bulletin-board, inscribed with the hours at which
      ships are sighted and entered into dock: the Kaiser was not there: and
      with prone outlook he went seeking an assistant superintendent; but,
      sighting a fellow-operator, come, as usual, to digest the world, from
      barometer-reports to coffee-quotations at Rio, Charles P. Stickney cried
      to him: &ldquo;Funny about the <i>Kaiser</i>! Know anything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the darndest thing...&rdquo; mumbled the other, still star-gazing at a
      blackboard prices-current of American staples: &ldquo;raise Hell this day, I
      guess&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      And on through the rooms Stickney shouldered: all in the air here an odour
      of the sea, and of them that go down to it in ships; pilot, captain,
      supercargo, purser; abstracts from logs, copies of manifests and
      clearances, marks and numbers of merchandise, with quantities, shippers,
      consignees; here peaked caps, and the jaw that chewed once, and paused
      long, and, lo, it moved anew; Black Books, massive volumes enshrining
      ancient wrecks; vast newspaper-files in every tongue; records of changes
      in lightships, lights, buoys, and beacons, from Shanghai to Cape Horn;
      reports, charts, atlases, globes; the progress of the rebellion in
      Shantung, and the earthquake last night in Quito; directories, and
      high-curved reference-books, and storm-maps; every minute the arrival of
      cipher cablegrams, breathless with the day's Amsterdam exchange on London,
      or with the quantities of tea <i>in transitu</i> via Suez or Pacific
      Railway; and the drift of ocean-currents, and the latest position of the
      <i>Jane Richardson</i>, derelict, and the arrival of the <i>Ladybird</i>
      at Bahia; and the probabilities of wind-circulation, atmospheric moisture,
      aberrations of audibility in fog; and in the middle of it the pulse of the
      sun, the thundering engines and shooting shuttles of this Loom; a tiptop
      briskness and bustle of action; a scramble of wits; a <i>mêlée</i> to the
      death; mixed with pea-jackets, and aromas of chewed pigtail, and a rolling
      in the gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this roar of life that word <i>Kaiser</i> stole: and it grew to a
      chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles P. Stickney, butting upon a tearing clerk who was holding aloft a
      bulletin of icebergs and derelicts, tried to stop him: upon which the
      clerk, who would not be stopped, cried with a back-looking face of
      passionate haste: &ldquo;London message just received&mdash;<i>no intelligence
      of Kaiser</i>&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he had hardly disappeared, when another man from an inner room rushed,
      waving something: the Navesink Highlands lookout had wired the <i>Kaiser</i>
      in sight! And while the Exchange rang with cheers, Stickney, a colour now
      in his sere cheeks, went boring his way outward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lookout had said it&mdash;those blue eyes that never failed there on
      his watch-tower, he knowing the ships that sail the sea as the Cyclops his
      sheep, in his heart so knowing them all, that as that sea-glass detected a
      speck on the horizon, those sea-wise nostrils sniffed its name: for
      between the <i>Mary Jane</i> and the <i>Mary Anne</i>, both off-shore
      schooners, is all the world of difference: if you would not see it, <i>he</i>
      knows. And he had wired the <i>Kaiser!</i>&mdash;so expectant his outlook:
      and that day wept like a ruined man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swift upon his first wire a second flashed: and one of those craped days
      of the tragedies of commerce followed, the boding, the loss, flashed
      everywhere, pervading Europe and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the Exchange, all the exchanges, the Lloyds', the
      bourses, were crowded from an early hour, but subdued: no news, not a
      word; but still&mdash;there was certainty: for had the <i>Kaiser</i> and
      her wireless been merely disabled, she would undoubtedly by now have been
      reported: she had foundered.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Foundered!</i>&mdash;in the serenest weather in which ship ever crossed
      the water....
    </p>
    <p>
      But at eleven the truth came: for the brig which had lain becalmed near
      the <i>Boodah</i> at the moment of the tragedy, and now was nearer
      England, had flashed the news: &ldquo;many of the Kaiser's passengers mutilated,
      many drowned&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Death, then, was in the pottage of Life; the air tainted with specks of
      blood....
    </p>
    <p>
      That day Man, as it were, rent his garments, sitting in ashes, and to
      Heaven sent up a howl of fear, of anguish, and of hissing hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who lacked the intelligence to feel the fear, felt the hate: every
      girl, the shirt-maker, the shopman, feeling himself robbed of his very
      own; the Duke in the centre of his oak-lands felt it; the burglar, the
      junk-dweller of the Yangtse, the pariah of the Hugli. Lamentation and a
      voice in Ramah, wail on wail. For God had given the sea to man, and it had
      been seized by a devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      God had also given the shore; and it, too, had been seized: but, as that
      had been before their birth, they had not observed it&mdash;in such a numb
      somnambulism shambles humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the theft of the sea was new and flagrant, it, and the air, being all
      that had remained: and a roar for vengeance&mdash;sharp, and rolled in
      blood&mdash;rose from the throat of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when Mr. C. P. Stickney during the afternoon wired for
      information to the White House, he received the reply: &ldquo;Encourage calm on
      'Change. Government in touch with Europe. Great naval activity. Await good
      news, seven P.M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was about seven P.M. that what the White House would have considered
      specially good news occurred: for the <i>Boodah</i> then telegraphed
      through to O'Hara's <i>Mahomet</i> at the Straits:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;B. 7651. Begins. After to-morrow (Monday) you begin taxation, as per
      Order B., 7315, of 2nd inst. But if warships desire to pass out, (not in),
      permit, till further order. Richard. Ends&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which meant that if any Power, or Powers, desired to concentrate force
      upon the attack of any island, the Lord of the Sea granted them
      facilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>Kaiser</i> passengers had now been sent off to New York, the <i>Boodah's</i>
      halls seemed the home of desolation; and, as the night advanced, Hogarth
      and Loveday walked on the roof: for they could find no rest, the sky
      without moon or star, the sea making of three sides of the <i>Boodah</i> a
      roaring reef, the wind blowing cold, they two wrapped to the nose in
      oilskins with sou'-westers, lashed by rages of rain and spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yonder, to the north-west, appeared a ghost, a thing, a derelict brig,
      driving downhill on the billows, like a blind man gadding aimless with a
      crazy down-look, the rags of her one sail drumming on the gusts; and near,
      nearer, within a stone's-throw of the <i>Boodah</i>, she swaggered
      wearily, drab Arab, doomed despondent Ahasuerus of the deep, nomad on the
      nomad sea; and on into the gloom of the south-west she roamed, to be again
      and again re-created by the rolling light-drum, while Hogarth with a groan
      said: &ldquo;If I were only dead! I feel to-night like a man abandoned by the
      Almighty&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loveday muttered those words so loved by Hogarth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;....this is my favoured lot,
  My exaltation to afflictions high&rdquo;....
</pre>
    <p>
      And Hogarth: &ldquo;Do you know what is burdening me tonight? It is the curses
      which the world is at this moment hurling upon me: as when one man,
      thinking evilly of another, sticks needles into wax, and needles of pain
      pierce the other...&rdquo; a sense of evil which was deepened the next day by an
      ominous little accident, when one of his old gunpractice hulks arrived
      from Bombay, bearing the throne: for as this was being conveyed into the
      <i>Boodah</i> a front leg was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the world's trade went on as before: only, night and day, its
      ships lay-to, to pay rent with threat and curse: in all only thirteen
      ships being sunk ere sea and earth had learned the new conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from the very first day of this taxing a deeper sense of pain and
      hardship pervaded the world, the Lord of the Sea now taxing at 4s. per ton
      a world's tonnage of 29 millions, 7 1/2 millions in sailing-ships, 21 1/2
      millions in steamships, once in a voyage&mdash;a little less than the
      revenue of Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one night he received message from O'Hara that &ldquo;British Mediterranean
      fleet has passed through the Straits, homeward&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not for nothing that the nations had allowed three weeks to pass
      before avenging the Kaiser: soon enough the Cabinets had been in
      intercommunication; but in the &ldquo;Concert&rdquo; had occurred&mdash;a hitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Britain had proposed the destruction of the islands in detail, the Powers
      to contribute weights of metal proportionate to their mercantile marines:
      as a basis for calculation she had offered her force in Home and
      Mediterranean waters; and, this having been accepted, by the 5th ships
      were under the pennant, and outfitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all this time, things had been in a pretty whirl: oratory from
      pulpit, platform, stump, eyes on fire, mobs that went in haste, shrieks of
      newspaper passion, organized burglary, and a strange epidemic of fires:
      for the modern nations lived by the sea, and it was seized. Moreover, on
      the 6th, after a meeting at the Albert Hall, organized by the Associated
      Chambers of Commerce, our Government&mdash;&ldquo;Liberal&rdquo;, under Sir Moses
      Cohen&mdash;suffered a defeat of thirty-four votes on a division.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was during the turmoil that ensued upon this that the German
      Foreign Office (on the 9th) sent to the new Russian the wireless &ldquo;<i>Bion</i>&rdquo;-meaning&mdash;&ldquo;Let
      us meet to discuss the subject of-England&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      That meeting took place at Konigsberg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now that a fort-man&mdash;formerly a Nottingham shoemaker&mdash;landed
      from the Truth's yacht at Frederikshavn, and thence wrote to the Daily
      Chronicle, to say, briefly, this: That, supposing the European navies
      joined to batter away with l5-inch guns and torpedoes at five feet of
      steel, they might finally succeed in mining a hole in it; but if the thick
      steel happened to have still bigger guns, &ldquo;<i>and other things</i>&rdquo;, with
      which, meantime, to batter back at the thin ships, then it would be the
      ships, probably, which would get holes in them: it was a question of Time.
      Also he said that the islands were defended by devoted men, every one of
      intelligence and high principle, who knew what they wanted, and meant to
      have it&mdash;their shooting average being 97 per 100. He advised his
      country not to try it, especially in view of certain political rumours
      which he had picked up in the Cattegat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, although badly spelled, aroused a sensation The &ldquo;high
      principle&rdquo; of the fort-men, indeed, met with bitter laughter; but its
      hearty patriotism, simplicity, technical knowledge, were so remarkable,
      that now a doubt as to the battleship arose&mdash;and with it a gnashing
      of teeth. The service-clubs, the &ldquo;experts&rdquo;, wrote this and that; the
      publics poured forth letters, schemes, plots, inventions&mdash;like the
      brain of the world <i>versus</i> the brain of Hogarth. &ldquo;<i>Starve Him Out</i>&rdquo;,
      was a title in the <i>Contemporary:</i> but the reply was bitterly
      obvious. And into the midst of this racket burst the news that the
      negotiations with Germany, Russia and France were at a deadlock.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Powers had raised this question: &ldquo;In case of the capture of the
      islands&mdash;what shall be done with those most powerful engines?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here was a riddle. For whichever nation took even one would score a vast
      advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, now, Britain had had the greatness of mind to declare for the sinking,
      in any case, of all the islands, the difficulty was solved, but the
      new-Government brooms would score a point and gain a trick, and they
      proposed the division of surviving forts in the proportion of
      fighting-power contributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Continent objected: Britain was &ldquo;<i>firm</i>&rdquo;; whereupon the French
      Ambassador sent to Downing Street his withdrawal from the crusade.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so when&mdash;on the 22nd&mdash;the fleets assembled at Portland and
      Milford Haven before <i>rendezvous</i> at the Lizard, the whole original
      proposal had fallen through: for here was neither tricolour nor saltire,
      only three German ships, only five Italian; the &ldquo;probability&rdquo;, moreover,
      of the capture of a sea-fort by England was imminent: and on the evening
      of the mobilisation of the squadrons feverish activity was reported from
      Toulon; a British Legation <i>attaché,</i>, seeing fit to stroll round the
      Caserne Pepinière, beheld in the yard an extraordinary crowd of limbers:
      and, pitching into a cab, from the nearest <i>postes et télégraphes</i>
      wired to London the word: &ldquo;Angleterre&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too late: the British fleets were gone, leaving the Channel and Western
      Mediterranean desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the nation awoke to a consciousness of dark skies: cloud of the west
      rushing to meet a yet lurider eastern&mdash;with probability of lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fleet could hardly return in less than five days&mdash;if it returned!
      Would the hostile nations be good enough to await its return? The
      lightning would be &ldquo;near&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day of fear, in which flash tracked flash: till at 11.30 P.M. the rumour
      pervaded the crowd round St. Stephen's that the new Ministry had suffered
      defeat: and the drifting ship was captainless.
    </p>
    <p>
      And early the next morning a number of <i>Boodah</i> boats, out running a
      regatta, came tearing back, all fluttered; soon after which
      Quilter-Beckett was hurrying into Hogarth's presence, who was at coffee,
      to say: &ldquo;Well, my Lord King, here they come at last&mdash;and enough of
      them, I think&rdquo;.

    <h2>
      XXXVI. &mdash; THE &ldquo;BOODAH&rdquo; AND THE BATTLESHIPS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The ships had gone forth in two lines ahead at ten knots, Admiral Sir
      Henry Yerburgh, K.C.B., being in the flagship Queen Mary, with the
      capital-ships being nearly all of the five mosquito flotillas, and half
      the Home submarine; though what was the object of the torpedo craft
      (unless they were to go within 2,000 yards of the <i>Boodah's</i> guns)
      was not very evident.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that news, Hogarth, putting on a wide-awake, and lighting a cigar with
      rough perfunctory puffs, ran along a corridor to call Loveday, whereupon
      the two went out to the ledge and up to the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, at the south edge, stood a marine trumpeting something at Hogarth's
      yacht; and, just landing at the <i>Boodah</i> from his gig, a fretful
      Yankee skipper, register in hand with a bag of £900 sea-rent in gold,
      while twenty yards yonder rode his smoking ship loaded with grain for
      Rouen; and on the eastern horizon the armada, in crescent at present,
      moving with fires banked at two knots, a glare hiding them from the naked
      eye, but the glass revealing them like toys in the abstract, ethereally
      hazy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the yacht's cones shewed steam, three of her boats making toward
      the <i>Boodah</i>; soon at the landing-place stood Wanda, some
      interpreters, Mons. Roche (the chef), women, engineers, paymasters, civil
      servants, waiters, etc.; and Hogarth, seeing them, approached, questioned
      them, and, hearing that they had been ordered a day's pleasure-trip round
      the <i>Solon</i>, with lifting hat shook hands all round.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time some fifty officers and blue-jackets were about the roof and
      ledge, some discussing, others unfixing lanterns and festoons, with
      shouted directions. Leaving which, Hogarth and Loveday descended to an
      office of Loveday's, and Hogarth was just saying: &ldquo;Quilter-Beckett could
      destroy a quarter of those warships yonder&mdash;<i>now</i>, if he chose&mdash;without
      firing a gun&mdash;&rdquo; when in, with flushed face and stretched stalk,
      hurried Quilter-Beckett, crying: &ldquo;My Lord King, I thought you would be
      here&mdash;just look&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He held out a Sea telegraph-form-from O'Hara:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F. 39241. Begins. Almost certainty of war: Germany, France, Russia
      against England. Three corps massing between Harfleur and Rouen, two upon
      Petersburg, transports at Havre. England undefended on sea. Ministry
      fallen. Toulon outfitting. Donald, Admiral. Ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, with an all-gone gesture, handed the telegram to Loveday.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with lightning energy he was at a desk, scribbling:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;F. 39242. Begins. To Donald, Admiral, Mahomet. Be in half-hourly
      communication with Beech's Bank, Paris and Petersburg branches. Send
      hourly bulletins of news. War to be averted by every means. Let Beech
      threaten. Warn Cattegat. Richard. Ends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And &ldquo;Quick, Quilter-Beckett&rdquo;, he cried, &ldquo;send that! What is the speed of
      your quickest picket&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fifteen knots&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, go yourself to the British Admiral. <i>Make</i> him fly back: he
      has years to attack me in, tell him&mdash;I'll write a dispatch&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On which Quilter-Beckett telephoned up for a picket, took the dispatch,
      and was soon away, while Hogarth watched his flight over the Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      An anxious hour passed, and by then a line of ships had been sighted to
      the west&mdash;the Americans at last; ten minutes later, the picket, too,
      was seen returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now&rdquo;, said Hogarth, watching her, &ldquo;I wonder. The ships seem to be
      coming on just the same. You have no idea, John, how the mind of people in
      office becomes fixed, like hardened putty in a hole: I am sorry now I
      didn't go myself&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some minutes more and Quilter-Beckett was pelting up the steps, his face
      pink as prickly-heat, blurting out: &ldquo;My Lord King! I have been grossly
      insulted...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; went Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met a dispatch-boat coming to make summons of surrender, and, in spite
      of my white flag, they took me prisoner! How I restrained myself&mdash;and
      these people in the hollow of my hand! When I got at last to the Admiral&mdash;it
      is Yerburgh on the <i>Queen Mary</i>&mdash;he 'pirated' me&mdash;but I
      have no time Yonder, you see, are the Americans. British won't go back: I
      doubt if they believe&mdash;'under orders', and so on. By the way, you
      shouldn't stay there&mdash;no longer safe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was away: for the moment was near, the <i>Boodah</i> now surrounded
      with a series of floating squares hanging deep torpedo-nets against
      submarines, on both horizons effusions of smoke, the ships no more
      visions, but middle-sized sea-things, seeming fixed in the thick of the
      sea, though steaming quickly. Hogarth watched them through a hand-glass,
      while Loveday, ghastly pallid, whispered: &ldquo;Come, Richard, come&rdquo;, but still
      lingered a little, seeing them grow up&mdash;like the infant, the lad, the
      hairy man&mdash;toiling at the bigness of the sea, looking stripped,
      prepared for tempest They were six miles away&mdash;five.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mute lay the <i>Boodah</i>; and, surrounding her, perniciously moved the
      ships at forty-eight revolutions a minute, hardly a cable's interval
      between the host of them, they seeming no more the playthings of the sea,
      but its masters, each a travelling throne of power; and as they pared so
      taciturn, with baleful aspect they trained their cannon upon the sea-fort
      in their midst: not a soul visible on fort or ships.
    </p>
    <p>
      A long while it seems to last, that noonday stillness, a noonday breezy
      and oceanic, the sea sharp-edged, hard-looking, dark-blue, tossing spray
      along its ridges, not rough, but restless, shewing against the ships white
      foams a moment, which silently glide away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But their Admiral is signalling: <i>Let her have it!</i> and in some
      moments more yonder to the far north the <i>Florida</i> breaks into
      quick-flashing ecstasy, like quick-winking Gorgon glances; and the
      north-east catches it in a single boom; and in ten seconds more it is as
      if Nature, with sudden yell, feels to her womb the birth-hour come and
      rueful throes: and where ships had been appears in one minute nothing but
      a ring of stagnant smoke, tugged into rays and out-sticking clouds,
      flushed with glares and rouges.
    </p>
    <p>
      And no question of missing: the <i>Boodah</i> stationary and huge; every
      shell told. But, the deluge over, that thunder-marred visage again looked
      grimly forth, a face new-risen from smallpox, an apparition, roof-houses
      gone, lighthouse tops, one of her great 19.5 inchers in fragments, in her
      casemates seventeen dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      But where now is the one-masted <i>Hercules</i>, which but a moment since
      went trembling at the bale of her own bellowing barbettes? The <i>Hercules</i>
      is in a Nessus-shirt of flame. And whither the <i>Hercules</i> is going,
      thither is the <i>Idaho</i> going, and the <i>Dante</i> gone, and gone the
      elongated length of the <i>Invincible</i>, and twenty destroyers, and the
      bow-works of the old <i>Powerful</i>, which stoops woefully there, screws
      in air, as the camel of the desert kneels and waits, while into her beam
      comes crashing the ram of the poopless <i>Deutschland</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the <i>Boodah</i> has not fired a gun!
    </p>
    <p>
      But now she fires: as the broadsides drench her anew, she fires, the hulk&mdash;all
      round the horizon&mdash;lowing in travail: and as there is no question of
      missing on the one side, so on the other is assurance, the <i>Boodah's</i>
      broad-sides of 19.5-inchers and 9.5-inchers, ninety-two in all, being
      fired by the hand of Quilter-Beckett, who sits at a table grim with knobs,
      buttons, dial-faces, in a cabinet near a saloon where Hogarth, Loveday,
      and five lieutenants are lunching; and where he sits he can hear the band
      in an alcove rendering for the eaters Beethoven's Ninth Symphony: hear,
      not heed: for two gunners in each casemate have sighted a ship through
      pivoted glasses, whose fixing, disturbing an electrical circuit, prints
      the ship's distance on an indicator before the Admiral: whereupon he
      touches a button&mdash;many buttons&mdash;in intense succession: the <i>Boodah
      bawls</i>: and the thrust-back of her resentment becomes intolerable, the
      ships just like fawns under the paws of an old lion whose grisly jaws drip
      gore; the sharks that infest her will fare well of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of forty-three ships fixed, thirty-nine are hit, eleven founder: wreckage
      so vast and swift, that the Admiral, still afloat in a <i>Queen Mary</i>
      pierced above-belt, is like a man stung by the tarantulas of distraction:
      tries to signal flight&mdash;flags cannot be seen; fires coloured
      pistol-lights: &ldquo;Retire!&rdquo;&mdash;and soon, all round, the circle is in
      flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hapless flight: the <i>Boodah</i> is an octopus whose feelers reach
      far, and they, within her toils, cannot escape her omnipresence. She sends
      after them no guns: yet they are blown to atoms; the sea becomes a
      death-trap thick with pitfalls and shipwreck; one by one they are caught,
      they fly aloft like startled fowl, or they succumb, and lean, and stoop,
      and sink: the sea, for mile on mile, proving a hell of
      torpedoes-dirigible, automobile, mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For in the matter of mines the <i>Boodah</i> had all the advantages of a
      shore, and as to dirigible torpedoes more than all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mines, whose weight was adjusted to the specific gravity of salt
      water, sank till the pressure at ten fathoms arrested them, they,
      electrically connected with the forts, reaching out twenty miles; and the
      whole network, charted to an inch, was coordinated with the range-tables.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ordinary l8-inch Whiteheads, moreover, were replaced by a longer
      design running 6,000 yards, the added length being occupied by the flask,
      whose compressed air runs the engine, they not sinking on finishing their
      course: so, if they missed, there they lay, a trap of 380 pounds of
      gun-cotton in the course of the numerous moving foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these three forms of the same plague the <i>Boodah</i> hunted the
      fleeing ships, and drove them stumbling through complicated miseries,
      amazed and thunderstruck: so that seventy-three only, several of them
      half-wrecks, reached her twenty-five mile limit; and, there, over the
      mines of the <i>Solon</i>, reassembled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amid the throng on his ruined roof Hogarth watched their flight and the
      ever-coming boatloads of blue-jackets through a mist of smoke and the
      after-smell of war, while under the sea wide eyes in hosts were a-gaze at
      a windfall of 2,400 bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      About half-past four captains and commanders of the survivors were in the
      ward-room of the Second-in-Command on the <i>Orion</i>&mdash;the <i>Queen
      Mary</i> gone&mdash;when he, with splendid infatuation, proposed a return
      to the attack, with a change of tactics to concentration upon one side
      only of the <i>Boodah</i>; but the foreigners pointed out the obvious
      added dangers; and in the midst of a wrangle a dispatch-boat from the <i>Solon</i>,
      eleven miles south, arrived, demanding the usual sea-rent, by draft, if
      not in gold; so out, at this unlooked-for incident, broke a new quarrel,
      the British for a whole hour resisting the inexorable; till the <i>Solon</i>
      Lieutenant, his eyes moist with pleading, explained their helplessness,
      adding that war between the four Powers had been declared that day at noon
      from the Stock Exchange steps: and only then the Vice-Admiral, breaking
      into tears, yielded to destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, meanwhile, was like a wild man, imprisoned, till his yacht
      returned at dusk with her excursionists; and without delay he was on her,
      and away for England.

    <h2>
      XXXVII. &mdash; THE STRAITS
    </h2>
    <p>
      In England, meantime, was nothing but dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Government, whose defeat was accidental, on being hurriedly patched
      up, threw itself passionately into the work of defence, calling up every
      enrolled man, while at regimental centres the enlistment of volunteers
      went forward, Weedon alone turning out 7,000 rifles a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the night of the Declaration the Under-secretary announced in the
      House that the Russians were moving down the Baltic, the French toward the
      Straits: and the next morning dawned with the dreariness of last mornings
      and days. However, soon after 1 P.M., the Lord of the Sea landed at
      Bristol, his yacht being one of the swiftest things afloat; there heard
      the known facts; and thence wired to Beech's London house, to the London
      Foreign Office, to Cadiz and to Frederikshavn, where he had wireless for
      the <i>Mahomet</i> at the Straits, and for the <i>Truth</i> in the
      Cattegat.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wire to the Foreign Office was as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come to England hoping to avert European war by fiscal means, not
      knowing that the passage of ships into open water was of first importance.
      Since this is so, accept my assurance, there will be no war, except on the
      part of Britain, which I should much resent. British Government, I
      suggest, should forthwith allay national anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;RICHARD&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Foreign Office did not publish this telegram, not knowing what to
      make of it&mdash;unless Hogarth were vehemently the friend of England,
      while every British being regarded him not so much as the enemy of man, as
      the special Anti-Christ of England. And how came he to be in England, when
      he should be at the bottom of the Atlantic? The telegram was passed
      through the agitated departments, but kept dark....
    </p>
    <p>
      So the afternoon passed without news: and tension grew to agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth spent the evening in his Berkeley Square house with the Manager of
      Beech's, examining office-books and specimens of some new Sea-coins, till
      near eleven, when, being alone, he put on a mackintosh, shaded his face
      well with hat and collar-flap, and went out into the drizzling night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even his Berkeley Square was peopled, and, as he strolled toward Pall
      Mall, he found it ever harder to advance, till he became jammed. Never had
      he seen such a crowd, all in the air a sound, vague and general, which was
      like a steam of thought-made-audible; till presently, while trying in vain
      to get away, he was startled by a tumult that travelled, a rumour of woe
      that noised and swelled, terrifying, the voice of the people, the voice of
      God: and though he did not know its meaning, it keenly afflicted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fastest of the survivors from the battle with the <i>Boodah</i> had
      wirelessed: on that commonplace bulletin at the War Office the news stood
      written...
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rumour of that despair had not yet attained its culmination, when
      another rumour roared after and over it, roar upon roar, like tempest
      poured through the multitudinous forest, joyance now overtaking sorrow,
      and a noise of roistering overwhelming lamentation. And all at once a
      great magnetic hysteria seized them all, and the many became as one, and
      the bursting bosom burst: men weeping like infants, laughing foolishly,
      grasping each other's hand, and one cried &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;, and another, catching
      it, cried &ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the French, German, and Russian fleets, in attempting to pass the two
      narrows north and south of Europe, had been stopped by the two sea-forts
      there; and though they had been so eager to pass, that they had even
      offered to pay sea-rent, this, too, had been refused. They had then, at
      five and at five-thirty in the afternoon, offered battle to the islands:
      with the result that half their weight had been annihilated before they
      took to flight. So said the bulletin....
    </p>
    <p>
      And Hogarth in the midst of the jubilee saw the man who jammed his left
      shoulder, a broker in spectacles, grip the hand of the man on his right, a
      ragamuffin, to cry out: &ldquo;That scoundrel Hogarth! Isn't there good in the
      damned thief, after all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the other: &ldquo;Aye, he knows how to give it 'em 'ot, don't 'e, after all!
      Thank God for that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three weeks later peace was proclaimed by a procession at Temple Bar
      between England, Austro-Germany, France, Russia, and the Sea.

    <h2>
      XXXVIII. &mdash; THE MANIFESTO
    </h2>
    <p>
      The last effort of Europe to resist the Sea was made on the afternoon of
      the 14th of October, when the British Prime Minister refused to conclude a
      treaty of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your master is only a pirate&mdash;on a large scale&rdquo;, he said to a
      Minister of the Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was on the 14th.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 15th there was a stoppage of British trade nearly all the world
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 20th England was in a state of <i>émeute</i> resembling revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 28th the Treaty of Peace was signed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its principal conditions were: (1) The undertaking by the Sea not to raise
      sea-rent on British ships without certain formalities of notice; and (2)
      The undertaking by Britain not to engage in the making of any railway or
      overland trade-route, or of any marine engine of war, without the consent
      of the Sea. And similar treaties were signed by the Sea with the other
      nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed the rush of the Ambassadors to the <i>Boodah</i>, and the
      frivolous round of Court-life revolved, <i>levée</i>, audience, dinner,
      drawing-room, investiture; the Lord of the Sea descended from the throne
      before the Court to pin a cross upon the humble breast of his best shot
      and give him the title of Præceps, gave fanciful honours to emperors,
      received them of them&mdash;wore when throned a brow-band of gold with
      only one stone, the biggest of the meteor octahedrons, that glanced about
      his brow like an icicle in whose glass gallivanted a fairy clad in rags of
      the rainbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the old gaieties recommenced, but more Olympian in tone, as befitted
      the ruler of rulers, terrible now being the lifting of Hogarth's brows at
      the least lapse in ritual; and only the chastest-nurtured of the earth
      ever now stalked through gavotte or pavane in those halls of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world now lay at his feet. The dependence upon him of England, of
      France, of that part of Austro-Germany called Germany, was obvious: he
      could starve them. But over Austria proper, Russia, Italy, his sway was no
      less omnipotent: for the panic cheapness of scrip which followed the
      destruction of the <i>Kaiser</i> had, of course, been foreseen, and used
      by him; Beech had bought up, easily ousting the Rothschilds from their old
      financial kingship: by tens of millions the process had gone on; and still
      it continued increasingly, for the wealth of Hogarth now, as compared with
      that of other rich men, was like a ship to a skiff. If he threw upon the
      market, the bankruptcy of several nations might follow: it was doubtful if
      the United States could survive; certainly, Austria, Russia, South America
      must go under.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was the East less his slave: Japan a mercantile nation, China and
      Turkey in his fiscal net. So, looking round the globe toward the middle of
      November, he could observe scarcely a nation which he could not, by
      scribbling a telegram, crush out of recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was precisely then that Richard Hogarth revealed himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 15th of November appeared his Manifesto.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Charter, which everlastingly must remain one of the Scriptures of our
      planet, simple as a baby's syllables, yet large like the arch of Heaven,
      has left its mark on the human soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 16th its twenty clauses occupied in <i>pica</i> a
      page of every newspaper, and it was posted up big in the streets of
      cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard, by the Will of God....I do hereby discern, declare, and lay down:
      That:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. What is no good cannot be owned: only goods can be owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. &ldquo;<i>Good</i>&rdquo; is <i>well</i>, or pleasant; goods is <i>well</i>th
      (wealth) or pleasures: thus, a coal-mine, being no pleasure, cannot be
      owned.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Coal <i>becomes</i> goods after being moved, or taken. Moving does not
      make it good; its nature does not make it good: moving-<i>plus</i>-Nature
      makes it good, ownable. At the pit-head, already, it is a pleasure, fewer
      pains being now needed to move it to a fireplace. Thus, Nature apart from
      motion cannot be owned, being no good, as a cave is no good to a caveman
      outside it: rain is wetting him; if he takes it, moves in, it is good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animals and plants, by taking things from the planets presented to them,
      by moving things, raise Nature into wealth, and own things.
    </p>
    <p>
      4. For Jack to <i>own</i>, have a thing for Jack's <i>own</i>, Jack must
      by his <i>own</i> force have subdued Nature, must have taken the thing by
      moving the thing's atoms, or moving something relatively to the thing, or,
      negatively, by not evading, but accepting, the thing in motion&mdash;a
      wind, tide, light-wave; else Jack must have taken something (by as much
      work) to purchase the thing from its (true) owner, or accepted it as a
      favour from Nature in motion, or from its (true) owner. To say &ldquo;own&rdquo; is to
      say &ldquo;take&rdquo;; to say &ldquo;take&rdquo; is to say &ldquo;motion&rdquo;, i.e., the doing of work:
      &ldquo;work done&rdquo; being FD, i.e., Force used into Distance moved-over. I cannot
      own the air: it is no good; I own the air in my lungs, having taken,
      moved, it, done FD on it: it is very good; and I own the air which, doing
      FD, moving to my face, I do not evade, but accept, take: it is very good.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say to Jack &ldquo;take a cigar&rdquo;; he loudly says &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;, but does not move it
      to his mouth, nor moves his mouth to it; instead, he moves a pen to his
      mouth; this makes me laugh: he has not taken a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack is catching fish in a boat; Tom owns the boat: so Jack gives fish to
      Tom, until Jack's FD done on the fish is equivalent to Tom's FD done on
      the boat; and now Jack owns the boat. If &ldquo;the law&rdquo; says that Tom still
      owns the boat, this makes me laugh: for how can Tom come to own two boats'
      good by the FD done on one only?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack is ploughing the sea with a ship: just there he owns the sea, has
      taken, is moving, it for his good. He does not own the sea before, nor the
      sea behind, him: for the motions behind made by him have ceased to do
      good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack is ploughing soil: he owns the soil ploughed, has taken it, and will
      own it while the motions he has made do good: so that, if Tom who has not
      moved it says &ldquo;I own the soil, for 'the law' declares that I have taken it
      by moving a pen two inches&rdquo;, this makes me laugh. Or, if Jack says &ldquo;I own
      it for ever&rdquo;, this makes me laugh. Or, if anyone says &ldquo;I own both the soil
      and the site&rdquo; (relative position), this makes me laugh: for what can one
      man move to make a relative position good? He can neither move a field
      toward anything nor move much toward a field. If many men move railways
      that way, or move things to rear towns round the field, this makes the
      site good, moving it from outside a community to inside a community; and
      the many who make it good own it.
    </p>
    <p>
      5. The site is the field's chief good: so the plougher owes something to
      those who, making it good, own it, This something is named &ldquo;rent&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      6. Suppose that the plougher, or dweller-on, is an Englishman: he owes
      rent to the English. And, since the site of England is made good by
      movements made in America, he owes rent to the Americans.
    </p>
    <p>
      7. This the mind readily descries to be true: it is a &ldquo;truism&rdquo;, and is
      necessarily the Fundamental Principle of Society throughout the universe.
      So that, summing up, we may define: &ldquo;Rent&rdquo; is &ldquo;right&rdquo;, based on truth when
      paid to those by whose movements a site is made good.
    </p>
    <p>
      8. One might readily guess (if there were no example of it) that any
      violation of a Principle so fundamental would be avenged by Nature upon
      the planet which violated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      9. Our planet is such an example: for here Two Separate Violations of the
      Principle appear; each great in itself; but one small in comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      10. Accordingly, for the small violation Nature has not failed to send
      upon Man a small penalty; and for the great violation great penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      11. The small violation consists in the claim by nations to have taken,
      without having moved, sites called &ldquo;countries&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      12. For this Nature has sent upon man the small penalty of War.
    </p>
    <p>
      13. To abolish War men must remove its cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore let the site-rental of England (i.e., the excess of English
      goods over what English goods would be, if no other country existed) be
      handed over to a World Council; and the site-rental of America to the
      same; and the World Council shall disburse such funds for the majesty and
      joy of Man: and War shall terminate.
    </p>
    <p>
      14. This way the Lord of the Sea indicates to the world, though with its
      initiation he is not personally concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      15. Beside the small violation of the Fundamental Principle of Society,
      there is a great on the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      16. The Great Violation consists in the claim by individuals to have
      taken, without having moved, sites and soils called &ldquo;estates&rdquo;, &ldquo;domains&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;plots&rdquo;: for, as rent tends to rightness when paid to the fifty millions
      of a nation, <i>fifty-millionfold</i> is its wrongness when paid to one;
      and as rent is right when paid to the thousand million inhabitants of a
      planet, <i>a thousand-millionfold</i> is its wrongness when paid to one.
    </p>
    <p>
      17. For this Great Violation of the Fundamental Principle of Society
      Nature has sent upon Man great penalties: poverties, frenzies,
      depravities, horrors, sorrows, lowness, dulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      18. Lowness, dulness: for by far the greatest of these penalties is a
      restraint on Man's development. Man is an animal, Man is a mind: and since
      the wing of mind is Pride, Assurance, or Self-esteem, and since the home
      of an animal is a Planet, and an animal without a home is a thing without
      Assurance or Pride, so Man without Earth is a mind without wing. Even so,
      a few, having Assurance, make what we call &ldquo;Progress&rdquo;, i.e., the
      discovering of truth&mdash;a crawling which might become flight, had all
      minds but the wing of Pride to co-operate in discovering truth. But Man
      lacks assurance and foothold, founded home and domain: his sole heritage,
      though he is neither fish nor fowl, being sea and air.
    </p>
    <p>
      19. This is a great violation.
    </p>
    <p>
      20. And with this great violation of the Fundamental Principle of Society
      the Lord of the Sea is personally concerned. In the name of Heaven and of
      Earth he urges upon the nations of men to amend it in the month of the
      promulgation of this Manifesto: and this summons he strengthens with a
      threat of his resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth, I will see to it.

    <h2>
      XXXIX. &mdash; THE &ldquo;BOODAH'S&rdquo; LOCK-UP
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days after the Manifesto the marriage of Miss Stickney of New York
      with Lord Alfred Cowern was to take place, this having been put off owing
      to the <i>Kaiser</i> tragedy; and so, on the day of the Manifesto, Baruch
      Frankl, the Jew, was crossing to a wedding which, even in the midst of
      great events, had stirred up a considerable rumour and sensation, since
      the American guests were to consist of the <i>coterie</i> known as the
      &ldquo;Thirty-four&rdquo;, all millionaires, while &ldquo;the cake&rdquo; was to weigh
      three-quarters of a ton, each guest's grub to cost $500, and for that
      breakfast the Neva had been ravished for fish and Siamese crags for nests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl, however, was never destined to taste those five hundred dollar
      mouthfuls. It happened in this way: as the <i>Boodah's</i> searchlights,
      destroyed in the battle, were not yet repaired, in the interval some
      lawless ships took the chance on dark nights to skulk past with
      extinguished lights; now, the captain of Frankl's chartered steamer had
      that bright idea (being of adventurous turn), when night fell forty knots
      east of the <i>Boodah</i>, so he came to Frankl, and broached the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for Joe&rdquo;, was Frankl's answer: &ldquo;pay the Pirate his taxes and be
      done&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It could be worked as sweet as a nut, sir!&rdquo; persisted the skipper, with a
      watering mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long us <i>you</i> take the risk, perhaps&mdash;but no, sir, I'd
      rather not&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      On which the skipper winked self-willed to himself, and, putting out nine
      miles from the <i>Boodah</i> his three lights, went dashing past.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the attempt would have succeeded, had it not been for the fact that
      the night was pitch-dark, and that <i>another</i> ship was trying that
      very venture with extinguished lights. And these two ships met, bow to
      bow, with such an energy of adventurous smartness, that both sharply sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sea, however, being smooth, all hands were saved; and now, since the
      boats lay forlorn on the vast, with nothing but the <i>Boodah's</i> swarm
      of moons to move to, for the <i>Boodah</i> they started, while Frankl cast
      twinkling fingers to the sky, and cursed that night, as the oars with slow
      wash journeyed through turgid murk toward the very den of the devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the <i>Boodah</i> they were conducted down to a
      police-court, and there shivered an hour in a dreary light, till three
      officials in peaked caps and frock-coats came, sat on a Bench, and, after
      hearing evidence, pronounced sentence of seven months against the
      captains, and one against Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were led away by police blue-jackets, and Frankl groaned through the
      night in a box as cold as the cells of Colmoor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Quilter-Beckett, making a report in Hogarth's <i>salon</i>,
      mentioned the incident, saying: &ldquo;Here are the names, with the sentences; I
      shall send the sailors home...&rdquo; and Hogarth's eyes, resting on the
      document, chanced to catch that name of Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      At once he turned pale, for his first thought was: &ldquo;Frankl must have been
      going to the wedding, in which case <i>Someone Else</i> may be with him&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But her name was not there....
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose and paced; and he said low: &ldquo;No one else on either of the ships?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then up lifted Hogarth's brow, alight with fun, and he muttered: &ldquo;All
      right, Caps-and-tassels&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said aloud: &ldquo;Quilter-Beckett, this Frankl I know. Did you never hear
      anything about Caps-and-tassels at Westring? <i>He</i> is
      Caps-and-tassels. Now tell me, which is your biggest blue-jacket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man called Young, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, have a suit of Young's sea-clothes put upon this Frankl, and let
      him be brought before me in the Throne Room this morning after the
      Audience. He was fond of liveries....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, by half-past eleven Frankl entered the Throne Room, where, as
      soon as its rosy translucency broke upon his gaze, an &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; of admiration
      groaned from him, in spite of his weight of misery, he not walking, but
      being lifted forward in successive swings by his armpits&mdash;up the
      first steps to the outer circle of balustrade, forward to the second steps
      and the inner balustrade, within which shone the throne, and Hogarth,
      crowned and large in robes, on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two warders, intent upon portering Frankl, and not noticing the cap
      which still covered his eyebrows, one now in sudden scare whispered: &ldquo;Off
      with your cap, you...!&rdquo; on which Frankl snatched it off, grasping through
      superabundant sleeves, he at the same moment a fury and a dazzled man, the
      throne before him incredible, like a dream which one knows to be a dream,
      in structure not unlike the Peacock Throne of Akbar, its length fourteen
      feet, seating thirteen persons in recesses, standing on a gold platform
      with three concave steps set with rings of sapphire, and consisting of a
      central part and two wings, the wings being supported on twisted legs (one
      had been broken), and made of fretted ivory mosaicked with cabochon
      emerald, ruby, topaz, turquoise, chrysoberyl, diamond, opal, the large
      central part, with its recesses, being also of ivory, gold-arabesqued, its
      mosque-shape canopy (of Hindoo enamel-work on the outside) being supported
      by eleven pillars of emerald; at the top of each pillar a dolphin (hence
      the name &ldquo;Dolphin Throne&rdquo;) made of turquoise, jasper, pearl, sardius, and
      at the bottom of each pillar a <i>guldusta</i>, or bouquet, of gems; the
      concave ceiling one mass of stones, representing a sea in which sailed
      three Dutch galleons, and seven dolphins sported.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all that Frankl saw of it was its opulence: for his terror lest the
      warders should let him go occupied his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      And precisely the thing which he feared came upon him, for Hogarth said:
      &ldquo;Warders, retire&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Frankl, all unsupported, stood in unstable equilibrium, anon
      stooping to his finger-tips, then straining doubtfully forward with
      struggling arms from a too backward poise: for not only did the trousers
      lie a twisted emptiness far below his feet, but the feet themselves were
      lost in Young's boots, so he stood like Scaramouch, a mere sack, a working
      of his chin wobbling down his beard, and there was a blaze in his stare
      which Hogarth, unfortunately, did not well estimate.
    </p>
    <p>
      They faced each other, alone, save for the body-guard at the circumference
      of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it <i>you</i> that sent me to Colmoor?&rdquo; Hogarth suddenly asked in a
      low voice, stooping forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Me</i>!&rdquo; shrieked Baruch Frankl, pointing a hanging sleeve-end to his
      breast: &ldquo;as Jehovah is my witness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you about to <i>swear</i>? For ever the same?&mdash;tyrant and worm?
      It <i>was</i> you. Now tell it me right out: you have nothing to fear: for
      you cannot be vain enough to imagine that I would harbour enmity against
      you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't me, I say again, my Lord King!&rdquo;&mdash;Frankl trampled a little
      backward, then stooped over-poised to his finger-tips: &ldquo;with what motive?
      Oh, that's hard&mdash;to be accused. They have already given me a month&mdash;my
      God! a month! And only because I am a Jew. But it wasn't me&mdash;that
      I'll swear to God&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth rose to his height, descended, put his hand upon Frankl's
      shoulder. &ldquo;Well, leave that. But&mdash;<i>my sister</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His hand felt the shoulder beneath it start like fits.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sister!&rdquo; Frankl screamed with a face of scare: &ldquo;Why, what of her
      now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frankl, you are frightened: you know, Frankl, <i>where she is</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? O, my Good God, what is this! Me, poor sinner, know where your sister
      is, my Lord King? Why, spare me! spare me, God of Hosts! Why, you've only
      got to ask yourself the question&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Frankl&rdquo;, said Hogarth, bending his blazing brow low over
      the Jew: &ldquo;I have searched for that woman through the world, and have not
      found her. All the time, mind you, I felt convinced that you know where
      she is; and you may wonder why&mdash;years ago&mdash;I did not have you
      seized. I will tell you why: it was because I had a sort of instinct that
      God, whom I serve continually with tears and prayers, would not fail in
      His day to show me her face: and to-day you are here. Do you suppose,
      Frankl, that you will go away without telling me where she is? And in
      order to hurry you, listen to what I say to your warders&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He touched a button in the balustrade, and to the warders said: &ldquo;If at any
      time this man should demand pencil and paper, supply them, and take to
      your Admiral what he writes. To-day his food shall be fare from your own
      table; to-morrow three loaves and water; from the third day one loaf and
      water; till further orders&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up shot Frankl's shivering arms, while Hogarth, training his ermines and
      purples, paced away.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was on the day following the Manifesto.

    <h2>
      XL &mdash; THE WEDDING
    </h2>
    <p>
      By the time Frankl's three loaves had become one, that amazement with
      which men received the Manifesto had commenced to give place to more
      coherent impressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a &ldquo;Monster&rdquo;! that was the first realization&mdash;no pirate,
      nor lurid Anti-Christ, nor vainglorious Caesar! And in two days, the first
      astonishment over, there arose a noise in the world: for the Lord of the
      Sea had given to the nations one month only in which to do that thing: and
      the peoples took passionately to meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In England Land Leagues, Chambers of Agriculture, Restoration Leagues,
      Nationalization Leagues, many Leagues, were organizing furiously,
      stretching the right arm of oratory; deputations, petitions in wagons,
      demonstrations <i>en bloc</i>, party cannonades, racket heaven-high. Sir
      Moses Cohen, the Jew-Liberal Leader, appealing to the strongest prejudice
      in Englishmen, spoke one night at Newcastle of &ldquo;the interference of a
      foreign prince in the affairs of Britain&rdquo;; used the word: &ldquo;<i>Never!</i>&rdquo;,
      and on this cry secured an enormous following: so that, within a week, he
      was instrumental in forming the formidable League of Resistance&mdash;destined
      to prove so tragic for Hogarth, and for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in the midst of this world-turmoil that&mdash;on the third day&mdash;the
      marriage-morning of Miss Cecil Stickney dawned; and that same evening
      Rebekah Frankl, convalescent from influenza, was seated over a bedroom
      fire in Hanover Square, a cashmire round her shoulders, her sickness cured
      by herbs, her physician then hobbling with a stick down the stairs&mdash;Estrella
      of Lisbon&mdash;her back almost horizontal now with age.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Rebekah mused there, two newsboys below, whose shouts pursued each
      other, went proclaiming through November gloom as it were the day of doom,
      crying, even in that uproar of Europe, a private event:
    </p>
    <p>
      MARRIAGE OF
    </p>
    <p>
      LORD ALFRED COWERN
    </p>
    <p>
      AND MISS CECIL STICKNEY
    </p>
    <p>
      APPALLING TRAGEDY
    </p>
    <p>
      And soon a girl ran in, gasping: &ldquo;Miss Frankl!&mdash;this is too awful&mdash;your
      father&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news, having been flashed to Paris by Mackay-Bennett cable, now
      appeared in detail after the <i>New York Herald's</i> French edition, and
      Rebekah's eyes ran wildly over details as to the &ldquo;bevy of beauty&rdquo;,
      daughters of &ldquo;the Thirty-four&rdquo;, and the church of waiting ladies, the
      carpeted path between palms and exotics, and how the ticket-holders heard
      the organ tell the Cantilenet Nuptiale and Bennett's Minuet; and then the
      multitudinous stir: behold the bridegroom cometh!&mdash;the little
      necessary bridegroom of no importance, and then the white entry of bride
      and bridal train, while the choir knelt to sing &ldquo;O Perfect Love&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perfect love, however, was hardly the order of that day, but rather
      perfect hate: for in Madison Square&mdash;the church being at the upper
      end of Fifth Avenue&mdash;a mob was being harangued on the subject of this
      very wedding: and when they heard and realized the thing that was being
      done before their eyes they were swept as by a wind of fire, and under its
      impulse set out like some swollen Rhone with a rushing sound to pounce
      upon the church, full of perfect hate: and the choir sang &ldquo;O perfect
      love&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happened now was described as a nightmare. The same elemental
      instincts of the Stone Age which had exhibited themselves in the
      $500-worth of food wrought in another form, but with no less savagery, in
      assassins as in victims: and a massacre ensued, bride and bridegroom
      passing away like bubbles, of &ldquo;the Thirty-four&rdquo; five only escaping. The
      report ended with the words: &ldquo;The ringleaders have been arrested; quiet
      reigns through the city&rdquo;; then a list of the guests, with asterisks
      indicating those killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rebekah searched for her father's name, and when she became certain that
      it was not there, her lips moved in thanksgiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since Frankl was not at the wedding, where, then, was Frankl? She
      counted the days on her fingers: he could not have been late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless there had been an accident to his ship....
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brows knit a little; she peered into the fire: and thought of the <i>Boodah</i>....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was possible that when her father's steamer stopped to pay sea-rent,
      Hogarth might have heard, and seized him. That notion occurred to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at once it threw her into an extraordinary fever, her bosom swelling
      like elastic in her heavings to catch breath, though she did not realize
      the wild thought that was working up to birth within her. She rose and
      paced, furiously fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he was in the hands of Hogarth?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a British subject&rdquo;, she muttered: &ldquo;Hogarth has not the right...Oh,
      he has not the right...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was fearfully agitated! something fighting up and up within her,
      stifling her, working to burst into birth; she flung the cashmire from her
      shoulders, her bosom rowing like two oarsmen. &ldquo;Because we are Jews...!&rdquo;
       she went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he <i>dared</i> do that&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What then? Say! Rebekah!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would go to him myself&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once that thought was born, and she stood shockingly naked to her
      own eyes, her hands rushing to cover a face washed in shame. &ldquo;But,
      surely&rdquo;, she whispered, &ldquo;I could never be so <i>bold</i>, good Heavens?
      Why, Never! Never&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      However, an hour later, with flaming eyes, she was writing a letter to
      Frankl's manager.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>
      XLI. &mdash; THE VISIT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frankl's Bank was scanning the agents' yacht-lists for her, when Sir Moses
      Cohen, who was closely associated with Frankl, placed his own three-master
      at her disposal; and she set out from Bristol, with her being three Jewish
      ladies, Frankl's manager, and a snuffy Portuguese rabbi who resembled a
      Rembrandt portrait.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late at night, and Hogarth, who had lately acquired a passion for
      those Mathematics which touch upon Mysticism, was bent over Quaternions
      and the quirks of [Proofers note: checkmark symbol] (&mdash;i) in an
      alcove of his <i>Boodah</i> suite hardly fourteen feet square, cosy, rosy,
      and homely: he sitting at a sofa-head, and, lying on the sofa, Loveday,
      his head on Hogarth's thigh, escaped from office and frockcoat, in happy
      shirt-sleeves, between sleeping and waking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth was interrupted by a telephone bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord King&rdquo;, from Quilter-Beckett, &ldquo;Frankl has handed to his warder
      something written: will your Lordship's Majesty see it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Then: &ldquo;John! Frankl has yielded!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Up Loveday started with &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; while Hogarth: &ldquo;When does my yacht
      arrive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At midnight&rdquo;&mdash;from Quilter-Beckett.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She starts back immediately for England with me and Mr. Loveday&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now an officer entered to present an envelope, and the two looked together
      over these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Lordship's Majesty's sister, Margaret Hogarth, is at No. 11, Market
      Street, Edgware Road, London. She goes under the name of Rachel
      Oppenheimer, I don't know why. As God is my witness, I repent in ashes.
      Won't your Lordship's Majesty have mercy on a worm of the earth? I am an
      old man, getting on, and starved to madness. The ever devoted slave, from
      this day forth, of my Lord King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;BARUGH FRANKL&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth 'phoned up: &ldquo;Give Frankl food now, and put him where it is not
      cold....&rdquo; and to Loveday he said, &ldquo;Well, you see, she is there: 'No. 11,
      Market Street'. And under the name of&mdash;what? 'Rachel
      Oppenheimer'...John Loveday, do you fathom the meaning of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;don't bother me about meanings, but shout, like her, 'O Happy
      Day!' I say, Richard, you remember that singing? how we would hear her
      from the forge? All day, washing, cooking&mdash;melodious soul! There was
      'O Happy Day', and there was&mdash;By God, how charmingly holy! how
      English! And, Richard, you remember&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another telephone bell: Hogarth turned to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just arrived in the yacht, <i>Tyre</i>, my Lord King&rdquo;, said
      Quilter-Beckett's voice, &ldquo;four Jewish ladies, a Jewish gentleman, and a
      rabbi, who request early audience to-morrow; they lie-to, and have sent a
      boat&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish! I shall not be here to-morrow, and even if I was&mdash;Who are
      they? By the way, no sign of the yacht?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. They are Miss Frankl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Rebekah Frankl&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God&rdquo;, went Hogarth faintly, stabbed to the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Agnes Friedrich, Mrs.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the rest fell upon ears deaf as death, the teeth of Hogarth now
      chattering as with cold, that haggard, gaunt yellow, which was his pallor,
      overspreading his face. So long was he speechless, that Quilter-Beckett
      asked: &ldquo;Are you there, my Lord King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quilter-Beckett!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go <i>yourself</i>&mdash;for me&mdash;to them? <i>Make</i> them
      sleep here, will you? This is most urgent, I assure you. And go quick,
      will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night did not the Lord of the Sea sleep: she under his roof...
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he go that night to find Margaret&mdash;nor the next day, nor the
      next, though Loveday chafed: for, gyrating through the giddy air of a
      galaxy where Margaret was not, he forgot her.

    <h2>
      XLII. &mdash; REBEKAH TELLS
    </h2>
    <p>
      At that time Hogarth, personally, was in close relation with the score of
      Embassies that inhabited the belly of the <i>Boodah</i>, these intriguing
      incessantly for half-hours at his ear, and in communication, meanwhile,
      with their Governments through O'Hara's <i>Mahomet</i>: so that Hogarth
      had to get up early, and his mornings sweated with audience and
      negotiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The German and Russian Emperors, with the Prince of Wales (then virtually
      Regent), had hurriedly met at Vienna&mdash;presumably for the discussion
      of the Manifesto; and immediately after it, the Prince, who had the
      reputation of being one of the most tactful of men-of-the-world, took a
      step which hinted that the Royal House, as often before, meant to come to
      the rescue of the country which loved it however the politicians might
      bungle: Hogarth was invited to accept the Garter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted: and the ceremony in the <i>Boodah</i> was witnessed, as it
      were, by Europe, King-at-Arms in a new tabard, with his suite, going to
      invest him, taking the Statute of the Chapter, with the Great Seal of
      England, and a set of habiliments&mdash;white-silk stockings, gold sword
      Spanish hat, stars, gloves. And the effect was speedy, the other rulers,
      dumbfounded before, said now: &ldquo;England will comply with the Manifesto;
      and, if before us, the taxed sea opens to her....Yield, moreover, we must:
      let us make haste!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But to consent was one thing: the <i>how</i> another: the mere suspicion
      of the willingness of Kaiser or Tsar shook their thrones. Whereupon Russia
      said to Hogarth: &ldquo;Recently dispossessed, they cling dyingly now to their
      lands, so I will <i>buy</i> the land from them, and <i>you</i> will lend
      me the money&rdquo;; to which Hogarth virtually replied: &ldquo;It is too childish to
      talk of buying part of a heavenly body from a Russian: have you no sense
      of humour? You may give the Russian 'nobles' some money, if that pleases
      you: but without my help. If His Majesty the Tsar is more afraid of them
      than of me, my only way will be to prove myself more truly terrible than
      they&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But high words hurl down no hundred-headed hydra: in France&mdash;fast,
      faster&mdash;with dizzy vertigo&mdash;millions were forming themselves
      into secret societies, while in England was One only&mdash;but stronger
      than the many of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the date of Rebekah's pilgrimage Hogarth had so far failed and yielded,
      as almost to decide that from the <i>Boodah</i> nothing could be done,
      unless he went to the extent of ruining and starving. The other
      alternative was the fixing upon one nation, becoming its recognized ruler,
      and there furnishing an example both of <i>modus operandi</i>, and of a
      subsequent state of happiness, which others could not long refrain from
      imitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this modification was still in the air; and, meanwhile, he listened,
      weighed, revolved: using men, impressing, convincing, extracting for his
      use the wisdom of their experience, estimating the exact pressure of the
      Time, the <i>timbre</i> of its roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      So on the morning after Rebekah's arrival his Gold Stick became his rack
      from the moment of the bow from the throne till noon: name after name&mdash;cordons,
      orders, gold-lace, sashes, stars, tiaras; till enter the four Jewesses,
      the bank-manager, the rabbi, Hogarth's pallor showing up his three moles
      and nose-freckles, adding a glare to his eyes, he suffering from the
      runaway drumming of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladies stoop through curtseys; the men do reverence; Hogarth bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      There like a Begum of Bhopal stood Rebekah, floridly reflected in the
      glassy floor, sallow under the eyes, smiling at him, he at her; and very
      quickly now, she once in his sight, he recovered comparative calm, and the
      strength of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your first visit to the <i>Boodah</i>, I think?&rdquo;&mdash;looking at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord King&rdquo;&mdash;curtseying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes: she is solid, and mighty, and rich. In my own, and the name of
      my friends, I beg to thank your Lordship's Majesty for your Lordship's
      Majesty's kind and good hospitality to us&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humbugging little beggar&rdquo;, thought Hogarth, his mind slowly gathering
      tone, but rushing meanwhile into a species of frivolous assurance after
      those agitations, his hands still cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;but you have not seen her! I think I know her fairly
      well, and I propose to be myself your guide, if that will interest you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Rabbi spoke with trembling voice: &ldquo;It is gracious, my Lord King. We
      are here, however, humbly to present an urgent petition to your Lordship's
      Majesty. Baruch Frankl, at present a prisoner in the <i>Boodah</i>, a man
      no longer young, and habituated to comfort&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stay&rdquo;, interrupted Hogarth: &ldquo;if you have a petition the day and hour must
      be arranged by negotiation between yourself and my Chamberlain. But
      surely, meantime, I may consider you my guest? Miss Frankl and I&mdash;have
      met&mdash;in the world. Come, ladies&mdash;come, sirs&mdash;say yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rebekah, standing averted, flashed a look at him, reading his heart, and
      Jews and Jewesses laid heads together, whispering a little, until the
      Rabbi said, bowing: &ldquo;We bend to your Lordship's Majesty's most gracious
      will&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Agreed, then, sir. We might now see the <i>Boodah</i>, and if you will
      luncheon with me&mdash;Mr. Chamberlain! direct Admiral Quilter-Beckett to
      meet me at once in the north corridor&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, master of his limbs now, descended, unrobed in an alcove, and in
      a corridor above the circular stair came upon Quilter-Beckett, who, acting
      as guide, Rebekah's hand now resting on Hogarth's arm, led them about the
      <i>Boodah</i>, now walking, now slipping in little trains over eighty-foot
      rails, rolled in one heat, laid down the vanishing length of dim-lit
      corridors floored with white tiles, their frieze of majolica, with rows of
      ceramics; and they saw the armouries, piles of rifles, cutlasses, pistols;
      ferneries grown by electric light; great cold-storage rooms that struck a
      chill, for preserving meats, butter, fruit; the doctors' <i>environ</i>,
      the dispensary, and roomy hospital; watched from a railing the working
      engines that fixed the <i>Boodah's</i> position, Hogarth here saying:
      &ldquo;There you have a menagerie of gnome-land: observe those two black
      beetles, sedately nodding; and there is daddy-longlegs, working his legs
      gymnastically; and the three pairs of gallant grey stallions, galloping
      grandly neck to neck; and those two ridiculous beings, rubbing their palms
      together, round and round: each preoccupied, comically solemn, busied
      about its own quaint affairs&mdash;like a varied gnomeland&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rebekah said in a meek tone, like the hen submitting: &ldquo;Yes, I see now
      you say it, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up stairs and down, round semicircles, up lifts, through nooks, corridors:
      saw the guns, and how by hydraulics everything was done&mdash;the hoisting
      of ammunition, loading, training: guns intact, guns wrecked by the
      Dreadnoughts; and shimmering kitchens, which reeked a smell of heat, and
      the dairy-maids, and the line of kine, and the row of prison-doors, and
      the mechanism of ventilation, fans and blowers, the drainage-system, and
      the dynamos for lighting, for supplying power to motors, for heating, and
      for shimmering forth rich in the search-lights; and the central ballroom,
      the clothes store, the original one-ninety-sixth model, the
      Ambassador-region, the steaming laundry, and the roof, where Rebekah saw
      her initials on the breeze, and the vertical pop-guns under shields for
      dealing with aeroplane attack, and the cream theatre, and the paymaster's
      suite, and the bunkers, the Government-offices, and the tax-receiving
      rooms, the telephone system, and the lady-telegraphists&mdash;till all
      were tired, though half had not been seen. They luncheoned together; in
      the early afternoon there was an Investiture, and she was there; for
      &ldquo;five-o'clock&rdquo; there was a Gounod concert in the theatre, and she sat in
      his box; at night the Bulgarian Ambassador gave a ball, and she danced a
      gavotte with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they parted a dying wind sighed his name: &ldquo;<i>Hogarth</i>...&rdquo;; and
      when Loveday before sleeping happened to ask: &ldquo;When do we set out for
      London, Richard?&rdquo; Hogarth with a laugh turned upon him, replying: &ldquo;When do
      we set out for Arcturus and the Pleiades? Do give one time to look round
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Rebekah, led forward from a semicircle of courtiers by a
      backing Silver Stick, approached within four feet of the Throne, and after
      the protracted humiliation of her curtsey, said ruefully: &ldquo;Our party have
      failed, my Lord King, to obtain audience for our humble petition till
      after four days&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that too long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We could not wait beyond to-night. Our good Rabbi, and my father's
      Manager&mdash;both must hurry back, and we others with them. This being
      so, <i>I</i> appeal to Your Lordship's Majesty &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A <i>personal</i> appeal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;&mdash;poutingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, I grant an audience&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;you and I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>No</i>&rdquo;&mdash;very low, with pressed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry&rdquo;, says he: &ldquo;it is the only chance I shall have; not for
      long&mdash;a few minutes&mdash;I am so busy. Otherwise, you will have to
      stay four days&mdash;and your poor father suffering&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She seemed unsure now, and his hands in the uncertainty of that moment
      were moist like melting ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, then, you accept&rdquo;, said he: &ldquo;a little audience&mdash;you grant me? Or
      rather, I grant you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, my Lord King?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At three&mdash;No, what folly! At four. Will you? At four? And here? Say
      at four&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke leaning keenly forward; and she, with a curtsey of acquiescence,
      retired.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were near again, and yet far, in the <i>salle à manger</i> at
      luncheon, a function of a hundred guests at small tables, with more of
      orchestra than of talk; and even as Hogarth and his train entered, and the
      crowd rose, she saw his eyes, by some power, prowl and find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards there were two hours to wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a heat of haste now possessed them both! Hogarth locked himself from
      his attendants into his bed-chamber, and, tumbling a chaos of clothes and
      uniforms upon the carpet, stumbled bitterly among them, hunting for a
      cravat whose effect he remembered; wished at the mirror that he had no
      moles and nose-freckles, or that his father had turned him out rather less
      black; and anon a delicious chill pang of mingled sugar and peppermint
      would gash his heart at the thought: &ldquo;<i>she consented!</i>&rdquo; He broke
      glass, dropped his watch to fragments, hissing &ldquo;damn the thing!&rdquo;; and
      about half-past three the hands of Rebekah, too, in <i>her</i> locked
      closet, were like the scattering sirocco among powder-boxes brushes,
      jewel-cases, and toilet-toys. What a hot haste was here! She too much
      blued her eyes, and bruised the skin in wiping, intense the contest
      between poudre blanche and poudre Rachel, violette and germandrée, she
      manoeuvring among mirrors to catch each angle of view, but with a blind
      impatience; and, if she wanted something, she tripped running, breathless:
      such a disease of flurry, an eruption and conflagration of haste&mdash;for
      nothing; yet, all the while, with a miserable sub-feeling of the penal
      creeping of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four Hogarth in the Throne-room alone was now afraid that he would not
      be able to utter a syllable, and wished that she would not come; then, in
      a minute, began to fear that she would not, and wondered whether he was
      not a deluded fool ever to have dreamed it, he walking quick, or anon
      listening like a thief in that half-dark: for few lights were shining, the
      hall like the after-flush of sunset just before the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four past four he was aware of a rustling train's rush down the steps,
      and now was like a man with his neck on the block, awaiting the axe. A
      moment afterwards she was before him, and two moments afterwards he was
      collected and hot, and a man again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dear</i>&rdquo;, he whispered at her ear, leading her by the hand to an
      ottoman in a near alcove.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, in self-defence, was repellent, breathlessly saying with galloping
      haste: &ldquo;No&mdash;I will not sit: you sit, and I will stand here: do as I
      say, Hogarth&mdash;or I repent and go: I know you, and you know me&mdash;or
      you should. Our talk must be short. You say <i>dear</i> to me: that is
      very gentle, my friend; but it was not to bandy such words that I am here&mdash;alone&mdash;with
      you and your strength&mdash;Hogarth. I come as a suppliant, to implore you&mdash;firstly
      for the man who is my father&mdash;and secondly for yourself, to warn you.
      You are said to be about to become the sovereign of England&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> am?&rdquo;&mdash;starting where he sat obediently before her,
      surprised that she should utter the purpose then forming in his mind:
      &ldquo;witch&mdash;of Endor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> am not the witch, but an old lady in whose predictions many Jews
      believe, who prophesies the return of the Jews to Palestine&mdash;through
      you. Be that as it may, if it is so that you are about to meddle with the
      institutions of England, oh beware, the resistence will be terrible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With respect to England I am omnipotent&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can starve it, but <i>will</i> you? You won't. And listen to
      your friend: there is now in London a society, enormously powerful I
      believe, sworn to your destruction&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can they do&mdash;assassinate me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! who knows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be too childish: I have sown my seed in Time, and it will
      grow: two thousand little lords could hardly obliterate the ploughing of
      my wrist. But you know this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, my father is of them&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&mdash;I forgive him: his daughter seems to be on the other side&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard, you would not touch my hand? Ah, my friend, I warn you&mdash;!
      Now&mdash;you have agitated&mdash;I have been ill&mdash;my father is of
      them. And who is one of the closest associates of my father&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The person known as Admiral Donald, whom <i>I</i> know very well to be
      Monsignor O'Hara. I think you might have been more&mdash;recondite&mdash;in
      your choice of an admiral, Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah?&mdash;you surprise me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why? You once sent that man to me as a notebearer: certainly, a
      singular selection. You must have known that he had been a convict&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought him innocent then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know now&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is it not extraordinary that your ensign bears my initials, while
      this man is one of your commanders?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess that I do not see the point&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you cannot know, I suppose, that it was against <i>me</i> that his
      offence was directed&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth's left lid lowered....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But my complaint is of the present: are you not aware of the scandal
      which the <i>Mahomet</i> is now creating in the world?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scandal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thrice lately whispers have reached me of unnameable iniquities
      perpetrated there&mdash;Alexandria of the sixth century, Rome of the
      second! I believe the rumour is widely spread in London&mdash;no woman of
      the world now lands on the <i>Mahomet</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was <i>you</i> whom he assaulted...&rdquo; Hogarth laughed and was pale at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but observe that I must go now, my friend. I have spoken of the
      things which I had in my mind: there remains&mdash;my father&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He shall go with you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you, my Lord King; that must be in an hour: so I say, Richard,
      good-bye&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not suppose you can dream how dark&mdash;&rdquo; he went woefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of which she took no notice, but with rapid speech said: &ldquo;How fair this
      hall is&mdash;one supposes that the art of impressions was lost with
      Solomon&mdash;like some chamber under a lake at set of sun, colour without
      substance, suspended, flushed&mdash;I cannot express&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sad, say&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Richard&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rebekah!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Richard, my poor friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have pity!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Richard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it, you are all mixed up with my blood, don't go from me. If
      you think it a sin&mdash;the Gentile&mdash;God will forgive the charity.
      Come for ever&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now he sobbed once, and, as he sobbed, she was on her knees, in pagan
      posture, at his knees. &ldquo;Do not&mdash;&rdquo; distractedly&mdash;&ldquo;see, I kiss
      your hand-do you doubt that I pity my love&mdash;as a mother has
      compassion&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now were heaving breasts, a vehement fight for breaths, wild eyes, and a
      live brand in the marrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will not go! I have you! In God's name, what a mad thing&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My furious king&mdash;you kiss&mdash;&rdquo; the short-winded <i>mélée</i> of
      whispers now suffocated in a passion of inarticulate breaths; but at that
      moment one of Rebekah's chaperons, wandering out of time and place, stood
      at the alcove entrance, and they, smitten into two, sprang straight,
      awaked from trance, Rebekah with half a sob and half a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      And two hours later Hogarth, from the roof, saw the Jewish yacht disappear
      to the East, on board being the four&mdash;and Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he descended, he threw up his head with: &ldquo;Ha!&mdash;O'Hara&rdquo;; announced
      his immediate departure with only a secretary and two lords-in-waiting,
      left a mystical note for Loveday, saying that he had decided to go alone
      in quest of Margaret, and went almost secretly, only the salute informing
      the <i>Boodah</i> as he steamed away. In reality he was in haste to face
      O'Hara, and the yacht's bows turned, not eastward, but southward, under
      forced draught, to arrive at the <i>Mahomet</i> in early afternoon. As her
      flags indicated the Lord of the Sea absent, there was no salute, and,
      landing in a panama and jacket, in the Collector's Office he gave the sign
      of mum, and, led only by a blue-jacket, went spying the depths of the <i>Mahomet</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many parts, noticing a singular odour, &ldquo;What is it I smell?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Incense, my Lord King&rdquo;, the man answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fourth floor he entered the loveliest <i>bijou</i> chapel, the
      coenaculum gold-plated, altar flower-piled, frescoed roof, &ldquo;stations&rdquo; in
      oils, where a lonesome Moorish youth slothfully swung and swung a thurible
      ruby-studded: but in vestments of no <i>enfant de choeur</i>&mdash;of an
      ancient Phrygian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another descent and Hogarth reached a region of laugh and harping:
      whereupon, dismissing his guide, he tracked the music into a nook so rare,
      that he stood amazed&mdash;a Court of Love, or Mahommedan Heaven, or grot
      of Omar&mdash;anything old, lovely, and devil-sacred&mdash;the air
      chokingly odorous, near a fountain some brazen demon&mdash;Moloch or Baal&mdash;buried
      in roses, over everything roses, bounty of flowers, a very harvest-home of
      Chloris, Flora in revel; and smooth youths bearing cups for some twenty
      others, all garlanded, besides those on the marble stage; and on the stage
      itself a scene of dancing girls, Sevillian, Neapolitan, Algerian, mixed
      with masked Satyrs, which made Hogarth pale, while at a Herod's-table
      buried under fruits, wines, flowers and gold, reclined Pat O'Hara,
      tonsured now, crowned with ivy and violets, gowned in a violet toga; while
      under a pendulum whose swings left whiffs of incense behind lay Harris
      insensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Hogarth descended into it, harp and dance ceased; some leapt to their
      feet: but O'Hara sat still, gazing in a dead silence through glairy eyes,
      while Hogarth, looking about, spied an electric button in a couch, touched
      it, and soon a man in uniform stood at a door above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Souttar, head-telegraphist, may it please your Lordship's Majesty&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make haste: tell the First Lieutenant and the Chief Constable that the
      Lord of the Sea is here&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now all the revellers were on their feet; no sound: only, the clicking
      pendulum voyaged, landed an incense-whiff, and voyaged, like traders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Lieutenant appeared, mottled and panting, and immediately the
      Constable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Royds&rdquo;, said Hogarth: &ldquo;is it practicable to flood this room quickly
      with a hose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;should think so, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See to it. First set guards at the exits&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned to the other: &ldquo;Mr. Chief Constable, I give all present, except,
      of course, your Admiral, into custody, on a charge of misdemeanour on the
      high seas. The General Prosecutor will, in due course, forward the
      indictment to your Summary Court. Have your men here with handcuffs&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again silence, till, in four minutes, two men appeared on the steps,
      ball-nozzle in hand; upon which Hogarth said to O'Hara: &ldquo;Follow me&rdquo;, and
      as the two passed up, O'Hara tottery, care hanging on that ponderous
      nether-lip, Hogarth whispered the hose-bearers: &ldquo;Drown the room well&mdash;man
      and woman&mdash;do not spare&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      To O'Hara he said: &ldquo;Lead to your suite&rdquo;, and, descending, they presently
      stood in a bed-temple, the bed surrounded with mirrors, and at the other
      end of the apartment an altar&mdash;pyx, six unflickering candles, and
      flowers, with rail and reredos, and maxims of St. Theresa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth said: &ldquo;Sleep two hours&rdquo;, and went out, turning the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in half an hour O'Hara had started awake, sober, and, clapping his
      palms over his face, burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Hogarth might be capable of impeachment before a Court of Admirals,
      followed by death on the block, he feared; and he rolled, groaning,
      tugging his tonsure-fringe, which, on the forehead, lay a thin grey
      forelock, thinking: &ldquo;Guilty wretch that I am! putrid, unwholesome,
      hopeless, I have befouled the holiest: how richly do I deserve to die!&rdquo;;
      and even as he groaned and smote, his secret mind weighed up the chances
      of Hogarth's action.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, listened, rushed to the door, found it locked, tossed up
      despairing hands, and tottered to the altar, at which he knelt, all sighs,
      and dying fish-eyes, and sideward-languishing face, and weary woe. Ah! how
      great the mountain of his iniquity: if he might be but once more spared,
      his evil remainder of days he would bury in some Carmelite retreat, with
      fastings and prayers; but no&mdash;he had too much tempted the Eternal
      patience, the sword was out against him. Yet he implored, he implored with
      groans: with half an eye, meanwhile, on the door; and, having with regard
      to Hogarth a piece of secret knowledge which he guarded deep for some
      possible emergency and use (the fact of Hogarth's Jewish birth), as he
      prayed, his brain with complete detachment worked out the question whether
      he might now reveal this with advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth found him kneeling, said &ldquo;Get up&rdquo;, and O'Hara stood, leaning upon
      the rail, too faint to stand unpropped, Hogarth contemplating him, tapping
      the toes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir! I know all: your whole past&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red as crimson&mdash;!&rdquo; went O'Hara faintly, with tossed hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Red enough, Admiral. You are a bad old man: merit death&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, God knows it, my Lord King! I do assure you, I am a leprous wretch:
      and I welcome death&mdash;I pray you, I pray Heaven, for it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have it, if you were a better, or a younger, man: but I will
      not stain the Empire of which you were chosen to be a stay, and are the
      shame, with the blood of such as you. You are beneath judgment: and that
      clemency which is our scutcheon I extend to you. Live, therefore, and
      repent, O'Hara. I, however, you understand, now turn from you for ever.
      And I discharge you like a menial, sir. See to it that within six months
      you have your affairs regulated, and send in your resignation to the
      Government&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned and went; and, as he disappeared, O'Hara straightened, coolly
      went &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo;, and took snuff. He lived, he lived: while there is life there
      is fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fumbling about, searching for nothing, all relieved and rescued, yet
      stunned, he suddenly exclaimed: &ldquo;What a noble fellow is my son Hogarth!&rdquo;,
      and knelt again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth in the same hour was away for England; and on the fourth evening
      thence, the street-lamps just lit, stood before No. 11 Market Street,
      Edgware Road, come for Margaret; his carriage waiting at a corner forty
      yards away; and though within the last hour he had realized vividly that
      his voyage to the <i>Mahomet</i> had given Frankl time to remove her, or
      accomplish any devilish device in his power with respect to her, he was
      now all prospect and expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was three-storied, mean, unlighted, with an &ldquo;area&rdquo;; from a
      neighbouring window a woman screaming down to some playing children; and
      under her a shop sending out that fishy fume which &ldquo;drove Asmodeus back to
      hell&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rapped, received no answer, rapped again without reply, then stepped
      down and back, looking up: and suddenly, faintly, but distinctly, he heard
      her voice, high up&mdash;<i>singing</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O what a pretty place,
   And what a graceful city,
  Where the striplings are so gay,
   And the ladies are so pretty &ldquo;.
</pre>
    <p>
      It was she! He ran and banged at the door: no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back again he stepped; and now a window on the top floor went up, and she,
      putting out her head, twice beckoned him&mdash;listlessly, it seemed, then
      drew in; and instantly&mdash;again&mdash;he heard her sing.
    </p>
    <p>
      As once more he ran to the door, he discovered now that it was open,
      darted into darkness, up uncarpeted stairs, making for that upper room,
      vague light through grimy stair-windows guiding his impassioned dash; and
      on the third floor entered a room with two doors, beyond one of which was
      the room he sought: but that door was locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At it he pushed, fumbled, called: &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo; No reply. And suddenly he
      heard her singing, not before, but behind him.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Happy day! Happy day!
  When Jesus washed my sins away &ldquo;...
</pre>
    <p>
      When he flew to the other door, and now found it, too, locked, gradually
      in that gloom all colour faded from his face; and the voice sang on:
      &ldquo;Happy day! happy day&rdquo;....

    <h2>
      XLIII. &mdash; THE LAND BILL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Manifesto's &ldquo;month of grace&rdquo; was passing, yet nothing had been done,
      second-rate Powers awaiting the Great, while the Great, appalled by the
      bigness of the demand, fussed and intrigued, consulted, fermented and
      proposed: but did nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last, on the 3rd of December, the First Lord of the Treasury laid a
      Bill on the table of our Commons&mdash;at the end of an Autumn-session!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 3rd: and on the 1st the Lord of the Sea had been captured near
      Edgware Road, the probability being that this Bill was brought forward
      with a knowledge of that capture.
    </p>
    <p>
      It consisted of three clauses and two schedules&mdash;called The Land
      Purchase Bill; and it had only to be published to produce the stormiest
      agitation ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Opposition was the Jew-Liberal-Labour party; and when the Labour
      Congress (met at Manchester) denounced the measure, there occurred a
      &ldquo;split&rdquo;, a Liberal-Labour cave, the whole body of Jews, numbering 87,
      retiring to the Government ranks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bill proposed the &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; of Britain from its &ldquo;owners&rdquo; by the
      British, the price fixed being 27 times the annual value, to be paid in
      settled annuities for entailed estates, and in consols for unentailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, then, the Government would buy London alone for 1400 millions and
      Britain for 8000 millions&mdash;a bad lookout for England.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the authors of the Bill chose a moment when Hogarth was living on
      bread and poisoned water in Market Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      It rapidly passed to Committee, and then to the Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on that night a terrifying rumour for the first time pervaded England:
      that the Lord of the Sea, having come to London at the beginning of the
      month, was missing, and that his person had been claimed from our
      Government by the Sea under menaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, when a week, two weeks, had passed, and not a whisper from
      Hogarth, apprehension had turned into certainty in the breasts of
      Quilter-Beckett, Loveday, and all: and at a hurried Council called in the
      <i>Boodah</i> on the 19th, when the date of Hogarth's landing at
      Southampton was determined, and his small train-in-waiting, his coachman,
      re-examined for the twentieth time, one certainty emerged: Frankl had had
      time to reach England before him; and the arrest of Frankl was demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now England in consternation almost forgot the Land Bill; Scotland Yard
      ransacked Market Street: not a trace of Hogarth; it dissected the country
      for Frankl: but Frankl was now in the <i>Mahomet</i>, safely conferring
      with O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      The popular tempest first directed itself against the League of
      Resistance: and at an attack upon its Offices in Victoria Street during
      the afternoon of the 21st Viscount Reid (the Secretary), and a girl, were
      killed by missiles; petitions signed by the nation raining meanwhile upon
      the Prince of Wales: for, apart from the wreck which threatened, Hogarth's
      popularity was at present considerable with the masses, whose instincts
      suspected those above them of knowing more of his disappearance than
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night of the 22nd, when things had an air of revolution,
      fifty-three men met in a house in Adair Street, W. (This runs parallel to
      Market Street, the backs of the two house-rows facing.)
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the warders of Hogarth: and the object of that night's meeting
      was to determine whether he should die, and when, and how; the Land Bill
      now awaiting the Royal Assent; and on the morrow British high-sea trade to
      be ruthlessly stopped, failing news of Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was double, with an arch in the partition, through which ran a
      rough-board table surrounded with velvet arm-chairs; the floor richly
      carpeted, though paper peeled from the walls; down the table a procession
      of silver candlesticks and typewritten notice-papers and agenda; the
      windows boarded&mdash;a second floor; and in a room near, Hogarth,
      shackled hand and foot, he having been borne through a subterranean way,
      made for the purpose, from the cellar in Market Street to this Adair
      Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      From eight o'clock men began to let themselves in at the two doors in both
      streets, and continued to arrive till nine, when a marquis at the
      table-head rose to speak, the others leaning back with downcast eyes,
      nearly all pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The point before them was plainly put by the speaker on the Question:
      viz., whether they had more to fear from the life, or from the death, of
      the Lord of the Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By a strange Providence&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;this man is in our hands: and we have
      the right to become his executioners. My Lords and Gentlemen, the awful
      decision rests with you to-night&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, one after another, they rose, they spoke: no two views identical;
      till at ten it was voted that the question be put, voting papers went
      round, and presently the ballot-result was announced amid a momentous
      stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty-eight had voted for the death, twenty-five against.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in that minute a key was heard in the room door, and in rushed two
      flushed men: Frankl and O'Hara, just arrived in London from the sea; and
      Frankl burst into speech:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope this is all right, my lords, my coming like this, and bringing
      into your very midst a gentleman who is not one of us. When I tell you
      that he is Admiral Donald of the <i>Mahomet</i>, turned away like a
      servant, how does that make your lordships feel? A house divided against
      itself can't stand; and this gentleman has a scheme in his pocket&mdash;he
      will read it to your lordships&mdash;which will crack up the Empire of the
      Sea like an egg-shell! So I do hope, my lords, that you have not decided
      anything hasty about putting away Richard Hogarth: for unless he is
      liberated this night, it means sure and certain stoppage of everything
      tomorrow: and <i>that</i> means my ruin, and many another's beside&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the Master called him to order, and addressed himself to O'Hara, who,
      in admiral's uniform and stars, all stately bows, grave smiles, in ten
      minutes had given guarantees, was a member, and in thirty had read a
      memorandum of a scheme of betrayal which everyone saw to be feasible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the vote of death was annulled; and when the meeting broke up Hogarth
      was being lifted with bandaged eyes through the subterranean way to Market
      Street, where four men deposited him near the house-door, undid his ropes,
      said to him &ldquo;You are free&rdquo;, and there he remained twenty minutes without
      motion, deadly sick, then rose, and, on finding the door, went wildly with
      dragged feet, tottered into a cab, and leant brow on hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the porch of his Berkeley Square house, Loveday rushed out
      to his knees with adoring eyes, having hardly hoped to see again that face
      of Hogarth, while Hogarth patted the bowed head, saying: &ldquo;Do get me a
      meal, and let me hear what has been going on....Oh, I am weary &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during the meal he heard all: of the Land Bill, the turmoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;is there no drop of generous blood at all
      among those people? Never again do I trust them to make their own
      arrangements I When does this precious Bill have the Royal Assent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, it is supposed&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo;&mdash;he started: &ldquo;and whereabouts is the Prince of Wales?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Windsor to-night&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Order the motor quick. I'll go&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was soon off, and Loveday, listening to the dark story of Margaret's
      appearing and singing, and vanishing, accompanied him under a frosty moon,
      snow lying on village-street and hedge; but, travelling hard, they arrived
      shortly after one upon a Prince who, a wakeful man that night, sat
      conferring with Private Secretary and Attorney-General, he having assented
      to the introduction of the Land Bill, then been alarmed by the storm, and
      now was confronted with the responsibility of either giving His Majesty's
      assent, and earning execration, or refusing it, and taking a step
      unheard-of since William III.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that state of embarrassment he was, when the Lord of the Sea was
      announced, and &ldquo;It is with heartiest pleasure that I offer to your
      Lordship's Majesty my congratulations on this re-appearance&rdquo;, he said,
      greatly and gladly surprised, without at all seeming so.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two conferred till three, when a secretary, at Hogarth's
      dictation, wrote a document and its duplicate: a contract between Prince
      and King, giving pledges on each side, private, yet most momentous; and
      each, having signed both copies, retained one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next evening the Clerk in the Lords uttered those unusual words: &ldquo;<i>Le
      Roy s'avisera</i>,&rdquo; and the country was thrown into transport by the news
      of the Royal rejection of the Land Bill, processions singing the National
      Anthem, bells ringing: and for a month the mention of a Royal name in any
      assembly brought the people to their feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ministers, of course, resigned; and, as the Liberals refused office, writs
      for a new House were made returnable for the end of January.

    <h2>
      XLIV. &mdash; THE REGENCY
    </h2>
    <p>
      During the next month England was in a general-election turmoil; at the
      same time a Land Bill in the French Chamber, and one in the Reichstag, was
      thrown out: whereupon a <i>ukase</i> from the <i>Boodah</i> announced the
      raising of sea-rent to 5s. on all ships over 2000 tons after the 1st
      February, the month of grace over, the &ldquo;screw tightening&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already distress in England was great, coal being at three-and-sixpence,
      bread at nine pence; a cry had arisen for the Union of Britain with the
      Sea; and on the 27th of January a plebiscite among the Trade Unions
      resulted in an affirmative vote of five millions out of an electorate of
      nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at this time the bulletins respecting His Majesty were of a settled
      depression: he lived, but languished; and it was understood that the new
      Ministry's first act would be the appointment of a Regency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then appeared a rumour: alterations were going forward at Buckingham
      Palace on a scale of splendour new to Western mansions; the Prince of
      Wales had passed three days, from the 17th to the 19th, in the <i>Boodah</i>:
      and the saying went that, on the night of the rejection of the Land Bill,
      a compact had taken place between the Prince and the Sea for a three
      years' Regency of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Excitement ensued, the matter becoming an election test: and 180 Labour
      Members, with 70 Liberals were returned pledged to support a Regency of
      the Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A definite coalition, meantime, had been announced between the Jews and
      the Conservatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was election so rolled in dust and noise, in the result the Jews
      having the casting vote: and if ever race was looked at askance, it was
      they now by the British.
    </p>
    <p>
      The session having been opened by Commission, a resolution passed Lords
      and Commons that the Prince of Wales be empowered to exercise the Royal
      Authority; whereupon the Prince at the palace, having heard the Address,
      read a reply, sufficiently startling to the country, though well foreknown
      to those present: he laid stress upon the new conditions of the world&mdash;that
      phlegmatic eye, which had seen so much, lifting a moment in punctuation to
      dwell coldly upon his hearers, then coldly reading again; the
      difficulties, he said, which he was called upon to face on behalf of His
      Majesty were not lightly to be undertaken, and his fuller answer would be
      contained in a proposal which he would make in the Lords as a peer of the
      realm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night in a crowded House he read a speech distinguished by
      extraordinary dignity and severity: &ldquo;My lords&rdquo;, he said at one point,
      slapping the table, though those eyes remained royally null: &ldquo;when will
      your lordships learn to recognize the facts of life?&rdquo; and, having proposed
      His Lordship's Majesty, the Lord of the Sea, to be Regent during His
      Majesty's illness, such Regency not to exceed a period of three years, he
      recommended a plebiscite.
    </p>
    <p>
      No plebiscite was taken: for within some days the sense of the
      constituencies was revealed, and the Leader in the Lords received stern
      hints from the Liberal Leader, which damped pride: so their lordships
      abstained from Westminster, their Resolution being passed by just a
      quorum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country wondered at the ease with which the whole went off&mdash;not
      knowing that those who might have led resistance had a thought, and a
      prospect, inspired by one Pat O'Hara, which comforted them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now a Deputation of Five took boat in the <i>Prince George</i>, to
      wait upon the Lord of the Sea in the <i>Boodah</i> Throne Room, where the
      Lord President read the information that they were a Committee appointed
      to attend His Lordship's Majesty with the Resolutions of the Houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are instructed&rdquo;, he read, &ldquo;to express the hope which the Lords
      Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons, entertain, that His Lordship's
      Majesty, from his regard to the interests of His Majesty the King, will be
      ready to undertake the weighty and important trust proposed to be invested
      in His Lordship's Majesty, as soon as an Act of Parliament shall have been
      passed for carrying the same into effect&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then read, and delivered, the Resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth replied, reading: &ldquo;My Lords and Gentlemen, I receive the
      communication which your two Houses have instructed you to make to me with
      those sentiments of regard which I ever entertain for your two Houses.
      Deeply impressed with the necessity of tranquillizing the public mind
      throughout the world, I do not hesitate to accept the office and situation
      proposed to me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Deputation departs; five days later twelve British battleships
      surround the <i>Boodah</i>, come to accompany the Lord of the Sea to
      England; and at eleven on the morning of the 9th, his yacht, borne in on
      the strong thunders of a royal salute, drops anchor in Southampton Water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had set so gorgeous a standard of luxury to Europe, that no one dreamed
      of making his entry into London an ordinary <i>fête</i>; and, as the
      procession traversed the triumphal arches of Piccadilly, he, swept to the
      gods in the lap of gallant sublimities, plumes, sabres, showering hoofs,
      squad-troops, outriders, showed to the Prince beside him and to the
      Czarowitz before him a miniature of Rebecca Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some streets cheered&mdash;not all much: but during the illuminated night
      all London seemed to abandon itself to revelry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Hogarth went in state to the Chapel Royal for certificate
      of Communion, attended by heralds, Sergeants-at-mace, sword-of-state, the
      Duke of York; and after &ldquo;the service&rdquo; communicated under a canopy at the
      hand of the Bishop of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, on the 14th, Lords and Commons had a final conference over the
      Regency Bill, when the Assistant of the Parliaments uttered the worlds: &ldquo;<i>Le
      Roy le Veult</i>&rdquo;; and on the 15th, the swearing-in day, a party of
      grenadiers with colours and fifes marched into the palace grounds,
      continuously to play &ldquo;God Save the King&rdquo;; while yeomen and ushers,
      together with servants-in-state of the Lord of the Sea, lined the great
      hall and staircase, life-guardsmen lining a vista of state-apartments
      ending in a Blue-velvet Room, recently decorated; by 2.30 P.M. Privy
      Councillors commenced to arrive, till at 3.45 P.M. the Lord of the Sea
      sent Admiral Quilter-Beckett to the President of the Council, ordering his
      presence; and presently was himself seen coming up the vista, accompanied
      by his own household-officers, to the Blue-velvet Room where he sat at the
      table-head, the Royal personages on each hand, his own officers ranged on
      each side of the entrance-arch; and now one by one entered the
      full-dressed Councillors, with bows which he returned, taking seat
      according to precedence&mdash;Canterbury, then the Lord Chancellor, then
      York; and last came and sat a certain Mr. Forrest, Keeper of the Records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth then rose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lords: I understand that by the Act passed by your Parliament
      appointing me Regent of this Empire, I am required to take certain oaths,
      as prescribed by the said Act: I am now ready to take these oaths &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon rose the Lord Privy Seal, made a reverence, approached, and
      read, while Hogarth pronounced after him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sincerely promise and swear that I will be faithful and bear true
      allegiance to His Majesty King George. So help me, God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do solemnly promise and swear that I will truly and faithfully execute
      the Office of Regent of the King's Empire according to an Act of
      Parliament entitled 'an Act, etc.', and that I will, etc. So help me,
      God&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then subscribed the two oaths, and after him the Privy Councillors, the
      Lord President first, as witnesses. It was then delivered to the Record
      Keeper, who deposited it in a box, while Hogarth presented his
      Lord's-Supper certificate: whereupon the Lord President bent the knee and
      kissed his hand, then the Royal personages, then the Archbishops,
      advancing in order on both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a week of Hope, the turning over of a new leaf, so the spirit of
      festival reigned, and was deepened when the evening papers that day
      announced that a <i>ukase</i> of the Sea had reduced rent on British ships
      by 1s. 9d. per ton, and was heightened when during that and the following
      nights Hogarth dispensed three millions in fêting England: his
      illuminations having no resemblance to those sickly twinklings, tremulous
      at their own cost, previously deemed good enough for the jubilee-days of
      an empire; the people were astonished: ample and planetary his mind, his
      hand right royal, and London, bursting into light, flashed tidings of our
      earth to Mars. It was incredible then that any had ever wept, or would
      weep again; the bitterest foes of the Regent caught the contagion of
      world-gala; Europe flocked to London; theatres were gratis; the illusion
      of the comet of the final night was complete, her lurid rays sprawling
      2000 feet aloft in stiff portentousness, prophesying Change, the parks all
      transfigured into universes of moons, crescents, stars, jerbs,
      Roman-candles, <i>pots de brin</i>, girandoles of rockets, pagodas,
      marquees, each tree a net of fireflies, while from five hundred and thirty
      balloons, with silent burst, snowed diverse fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new reign opened with promise.

    <h2>
      XLV. &mdash; ESTRELLA, THE PROPHETESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      For three weeks a Provisional Ministry carried on the Government,
      confining itself to Supply; till, on the 3rd March, the Lord Regent
      succeeded in forming a Cabinet; and at 9 on the evening of the 5th for the
      first time addressed himself to the country in the House of Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the world seemed hushed to listen, the peridom of Britain
      packing the Gallery with rainbow, and the peerdom those benches and
      cross-benches, red as massacre and the Scarlet Woman, where thronged 580,
      while to Charing Cross spread the crowd without. He, from the Throne,
      addressed them, and they, startled by the revelation of a caste chaster
      far than Vere de Vere, and a pride far more serenely throned than
      Hohenzollern, acknowledged him high-born... &ldquo;Your lordships will not fail
      to perceive my will to invigorate some of our ancient epithets: thus, the
      First Estate of the Realm shall, during the present Regency, be veritably
      'First', and in no case last&rdquo;; anon he blew his bugle: &ldquo;Let us play the
      man!&mdash;easy to say, hard to do: yet it was first said by an Englishman
      when the doing, I think, was hard enough, his martyr's shroud already rapt
      aloft in flame: <i>that</i> was magnanimous, my lords, I declare! <i>there</i>
      was the British Lion&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night a new Land Bill was introduced by Sir Robert Wortley, the
      Prime Minister&mdash;a bill drafted, criticized, and re-altered during two
      years by the legal experts of the Sea, proposing the &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; of Great
      Britain at a price of twice the annual value for inherited land, and seven
      times for land held by purchase: this to be paid in two and seven years
      respectively, without interest, lands yielding no revenue to become
      crown-lands from the date of the Bill, which was called: Land Department
      (Creation) Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It passed first reading; but the question was: would the Jews vote for the
      second reading? Reluctant enough the Jewish members, but there were
      rumours that the Jewish electorate were instructing their representatives
      to repent and vote for.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now spread far the League of Resistance, so did the Adair Street
      Society, its secret daughter, of which Admiral Donald (O'Hara) had now
      been elected Honorary Vice-Master, and whose Roll contained the names of
      an extraordinary number of Territorial officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Society was busy: had building four yachts, all models of the
      Admiral's yacht attached to the <i>Mahomet</i>, which was called the <i>Mahomet
      II</i>; every dusk companies of 25 to 40 men drilled darkly in the back
      yard at Adair Street, some of them Territorial officers: in rotation they
      came, they drilled, over 1000; a top room piled with revolvers, swords,
      bowie-knives...
    </p>
    <p>
      For the land-magnates laughed at the notion of submitting to the Bill:
      rather, said they, &ldquo;rivers of blood&rdquo;. The mention by Hogarth of Ridley and
      Latimer they considered irrelevant; their fathers' heroic mood was a
      detail: not an entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      In secret they met. Anarchists of the reddest hue.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night when the Bill was approaching second-reading Frankl introduced
      Harris as a member; and wide-eyed stood Harris, though still cynical, with
      elegant walking-stick, hat cocked, and &ldquo;I sye&rdquo;, he whispered, &ldquo;are all
      these real, living lords?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Large as life&rdquo;, answered Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strike me dotty! The Lord said unto my lord, sit thou at my right
      hand&rdquo;...the reason of this introduction of Harris being a relation which
      had arisen between the Army and the Lord Regent, who had been taking a
      startling interest in this branch of the services, had visited Aldershot,
      and held five reviews, flattering the soldier by private notice, shifting
      officers. By an Order in Council of the 3rd March, a reorganization was
      effected in the Army Board and Consultative Council, of the new men the
      Adjutant-General being General Sir Merrick Parr, uncle of Admiral Parr of
      the sea-fort <i>Shakespeare</i>, while the Commander-in-Chief and
      Inspector-General were the direct creations of the Regent, and the whole
      Headquarters Staff bound to follow him through thick and thin; and that
      &ldquo;second reading&rdquo; was near, which, if the Jews would vote against, well and
      good for Adair Street, but, if not, there remained either (1) the prompt
      execution of O'Hara's scheme without waiting for the four yachts, copies
      of the <i>Mahomet II</i>, which were slow in building; or (2) the knife of
      Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as to (1), when three delegates from the Society had waited upon
      O'Hara in the <i>Mahomet</i> to urge immediate action, O'Hara had replied:
      &ldquo;No, my lords, I cannot enter into this undertaking until preparations are
      complete, since the troops we send would never be allowed to land on the
      forts, if they arrived in ships not apparently our own. Your lordships
      cannot be more anxious than I to rid the earth of a devouring lion like
      Richard Hogarth, I do assure you; but, tut, is there nothing else
      meanwhile? Just let me introduce to your lordships a little young man whom
      I know&rdquo;&mdash;he had summoned Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the three delegates had gone, he had struck his brow, exclaiming:
      &ldquo;Wretch that I am!&mdash;that great and good fellow, the fairest of the
      sons of men!...what a black depravity must be in this heart&mdash;&rdquo; he had
      underlooked in the mirror, and cut a face; &ldquo;but ah, Hogarth! this heart is
      in your net; and I loved the mother, too&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sought the altar, and that night had written piteously to Hogarth,
      appealing for fresh friendship and reconsideration of his sentence of
      dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, at any rate, was Harris introduced to Adair Street, became its chief
      minister, and ten days before the second-reading debate had won, by
      O'Hara's recommendation, an <i>entrée</i> into the Palace as servant to a
      gentleman-usher-daily-waiter: and now he made bright the knife of the
      assassin, tending its edge as a gardener the tender sprout, the knife
      being his <i>métier</i> and forte, he despising the noisy, mediate,
      uncertain pistol, nor could use it, his instincts belonging to the Stone
      Age. But the days passed, and he could by no means get near to Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night he boldly penetrated to the royal antechamber with the knife
      under his waist-band, having passed the stairs-guard by a specious
      official envelope. As it was late, he thought it must be about the
      Regent's bedtime, having the vaguest ideas as to royal ways and bedtimes,
      Hogarth being then in a consultation with three of the Cabinet destined to
      last till morning. And Harris: &ldquo;Can I see the Lord Regent?&rdquo; with that
      lifted brow of perpetual surprise and alertness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You? Who are you?&rdquo; asked a gentleman-in-waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's neither 'ere nor there, if it comes to that. I'm Captain
      Macnaghten's man, then&rdquo;.

      &ldquo;But what is it you want?&rdquo;

      &ldquo;He told me to give the Regent this 'ere&rdquo;&mdash;showing the envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Weally! then, give it to me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said I was to give it to the Regent's self&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, go to blazes quickly, will you? and let Captain Macnaghten know
      fwom me that he has been dwinking&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harris could not penetrate the ten-fold barrier; but he lay in wait;
      watched from some coign every Royal exit and entrance, careful that
      Hogarth never saw his face; and he cherished the knife-edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, four days before the debate, he stood by the Green Park
      railings, listless, smoking, when&mdash;he started: saw a hurried figure
      come out&mdash;face muffled&mdash;Hogarth!&mdash;alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth walked a little, entered a cab; Harris, in another, shadowed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down Piccadilly, the Hammersmith Road, into the Addison: Hogarth alighted;
      Harris followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, at this time Hogarth had a spy, who presented him reports of the
      doings of Rebekah Frankl&mdash;a species of literature which the Regent
      found agreeable; and, as for two days Rebekah had, for some reason, been
      at a villa of Addison Road, this escapade of the Lord Regent was motived
      by his hope of catching there some glimpse of her, the house being small,
      he having seized his first chance of secret escape from state-affairs near
      midnight: and behind him, like the shadow of death, stole the assassin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, going soft up to the house, leaned aside from the frontage steps
      to peer; but Venetian blinds barred him from the least sight of the
      interior, though he could hear sounds, strange sounds, as of wailing; and,
      as the villa was in the midst of quite a spacious ground, well grown with
      trees and shrubberies, he stole round to the back, peered into an open
      door level with the garden, and within saw a doorway of twilight in the
      midst of darkness; had hoped to see a servant, who might talk gossip, or
      even contrive him sight of the Sacred Body; had ready bribe in hand: but
      nobody there. So, after some hesitation, he entered; and Harris, just then
      come to the house-corner on tiptoe, discerned him go in, ran on hot bricks
      to the door, and now distinctly saw Hogarth, who had passed through a
      kitchen, standing on three wooden steps before a doorway which framed a
      faint light in the room beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      On which a shivering of eagerness, quick as winking sheet-lightning, shook
      Harris' right knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, meantime, having seen the chamber before him empty, in his
      headlong way had entered, and the guess now in Harris' mind was this:
      &ldquo;It's a girl: a night out&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated, Hogarth being once within the house and lost to him, but
      after some minutes dared to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth, meantime, had seen that the light came from a death-taper, with
      which was a vessel of water for ceremonial purification, and a napkin,
      here being all the preparations for <i>tahara</i> (washing); and suddenly,
      in a near room, arose the clamorous dole of <i>shivah</i> (the seven
      mourning-days), Rachel weeping for her children, because they are not: a
      Jew was dead: &ldquo;shema, Yisrael...&rdquo;: and this explained Rebekah's stay
      there, for the bereaved may not leave the house. A peer at the bed&mdash;a
      covered face&mdash;pierced him with a compunction like shame: here was <i>kodesh</i>,
      and he a desecrator with his earthy passion: so he turned to beat a
      retreat by the way he had come&mdash;when a faint sound that way, made by
      Harris; and, instead, he leapt lightly through a window five feet above
      the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some moments later Harris, entering on prowling all-fours, and seeing the
      bed-clothes hang immediately near, stole under; waited: no sound save the
      singsong lament; and &ldquo;O Gawd&rdquo;, thought he, cynic even in his palest
      agitation, &ldquo;there shall be weeping and wailing and gnashing of
      teeth&rdquo;....But that Hogarth had not come to wail and gnash he felt
      convinced: if he heard no sound above him, that might be because of the
      sounds around; so he crawled barely out, and, kneeling, put up a most
      cautious groping hand, the bed being in the darkest part of the room;
      someone there: and swiftly as a dolphin twists to dart and snap, his knife
      was in a breast and instantly ready to strike its expected bedfellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the breast was alone, the breast of Estrella, the Prophetess, four
      days dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harris snatched off the face-cloth, peered upon a noble old visage, fixed
      now in trance, and said: &ldquo;Well, I'm&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now he ran, but in the kitchen stopped wild-eyed. It I might be murder-he
      was not certain; at least it was out-rage, and he might be traced: there
      was the cabman who had brought him&mdash;his absence from the Palace&mdash;-&ldquo;Bah!
      it can't be proved....&rdquo; But still, if he were even arrested, and Hogarth
      got to hear of his presence about the Court&mdash;that would spoil all. He
      listened: all that part of the house a settled solitude, the servants
      themselves sitting <i>shivah</i>; and back he ran, seized upon the little
      old body, not now stiff, <i>rigor mortis</i> having passed, saw that the
      sheet was unstained, and snatched her away out to the bottom of the garden
      where shrubbery and holly-hedge formed a jungle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he set to dig with hissing haste; and, even as he hissed and digged,
      he talked without pause, envenomed, heaping her sanctity with insult: &ldquo;Old
      cat you...dust to dust and ashes to ashes, it is....What you want to do
      that for? under you go in the cold, cold sod....Who arst you to put your
      little finger in the pie? There's another one for you, fair in the gullet!
      Now take her up tenderly, lift her with care-and down she goes&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      Such were Estrella's <i>kaddish</i> and &ldquo;House of Life&rdquo;....As he had only
      the knife, and the work was slow, and in the midst of it an outcry from
      the house, the body missed, he stopped, listening, but without acute fear,
      knowing it improbable that they could dream of seeking in the grounds, and
      as a matter of fact their minds were a mere paralysis of holy wonder; so
      presently he had the little body in a two-foot grave, arranged surface and
      dead leaves to naturalness, leapt a wall, and got away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never did act of assassin have result so momentous: for though the
      predictions of Estrella had lately spread far among upper-class Jews, it
      was only on the day after her burial by Harris that her fame reached to
      each Jew under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was given out that divine confirmation had been vouchsafed to her
      prophecies by the snatching of her body, like Enoch's, into Heaven, or by
      its burial, like Moses', by Jahvah: for when no explanation but one is
      extant, the brain fastens upon that, and embraces it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as Estrella, who, in life, had guarded her hard sayings for the few,
      had left papers revealing for her whole race what she had dreamed, like
      wildfire now ran her message among the Chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Temple and Synagogue were crowded: rabbi and pawnbroker and <i>maggid,</i>
      clothes-man and <i>takif,</i> were infected; and there spread the cry (for
      the most part meaningless): &ldquo;To Zion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be that the Jewish electorate were now too agitated with the near
      probability of Shiloh to interest themselves in any mundane question: at
      all events, it was during that rage that the Government-whips announced
      the certainty that the Jewish members would vote against the Land Bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth first heard it pretty late at night from the Prime Minister; and
      &ldquo;Ha!-the Jews&rdquo;, he went: &ldquo;so they have dared, these men? I never thought
      that they would! May God deliver me from His ill-chosen people&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ill-choosing, it seems, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so! But, Sir Robert Wortley, is it supportable this thing?&rdquo;&mdash;a
      brand now on his brow&mdash;&ldquo;an alien race in Britain opposing thus
      daringly not <i>my</i> will only, but the plain will of the people? And
      have I the air of one who will support it? Rather, I assure you, would I
      govern without a Parliament! But stop&mdash;perhaps I shall be found
      capable of dealing with these mischievous children of Israel. Give me a
      night: and to-morrow at noon come, and hear. Of course, this
      second-reading business must be postponed &ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And deep and wide, in lonely vigil, wrought the Regent's thought that
      night, till morning: of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, of tendencies,
      histories, soils, ports, railways, possibilities, race-genius, analogies,
      destinies; of Rothschild and I Solomon; of Hirsch and Y'hudah Hanassi; of
      the Jewish Board of Guardians, Rab Asa, and the Targum on the Babylonish
      Talmud; of the Barbary Jews, the Samaritans, and Y'hudah Halevi; of the
      Colonial Bank, and the Karaite Jews....
    </p>
    <p>
      When at dawn he threw himself dressed into bed, he had resolved upon a
      very great thing: their expulsion from England, Pole and Hungarian, Baron
      and coster, and the little child at the breast, ten millions.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes had closed toward sleep when, with a start, he remembered a
      prophecy uttered one evening in the <i>Boodah</i> Throne-room, and these
      words: &ldquo;Richard, deal gently with my people....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Two nights later, with a retinue, he hurriedly left England-for
      Constantinople.

    <h2>
      XLVI. &mdash; THE ORDER IN COUNCIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      Three days before that setting-out, O'Hara's appeal for pardon had come
      under the Regent's notice: and as he had read, his eyes&mdash;once more&mdash;had
      softened, as he had thought: &ldquo;It would be a great crime to forgive him the
      long list; but never mind&mdash;we will see&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      And he had meant to reply, but suddenly the Jews had swept O'Hara quite
      out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was away hardly two weeks: and when he returned, Palestine and western
      Armenia were his, all his acts of this period bearing resemblance in
      largeness and rage to the incredible forced-marches of Napoleon.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one spreads apart the first two fingers, he sees exactly the country
      ordained by Hogarth for modern Israel: the first finger Palestine, looking
      upon the Mediterranean; between the fingers, the Syrian Desert; the second
      (longer) finger that Mesopotamia, &ldquo;the cradle of our race&rdquo; between the
      Euphrates and the Tigris, this opening upon the Persian Gulf, and the
      trade of the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      The then population of this area was only 300,000 (Arabs, Turks, Jews,
      Greeks) in the Palestine finger, omitting Russian pilgrims to Jerusalem;
      while in the Mesopotamia finger&mdash;all that Hinterland of Palestine
      called &ldquo;Turkish Armenia&rdquo;&mdash;not 320,000 Armenians had been left by
      Khurdish rapine and Turkish atrocity: we may therefore say that the whole
      was an uninhabited land waiting for inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only things needed (according to modern notions) to make it
      immediately colonizable were roads and railways, and the Regent had not
      returned to Dover when both were making in Palestine, the Sultan, left
      thunderstruck with a chronic eye of scare by that visit, &ldquo;lending his
      co-operation&rdquo;, consoled meanwhile by a Conversion Loan of thirteen
      millions out of Sea-revenue; to which add a grant-in-aid of fifteen
      millions to the emigrants, and the remark of Hogarth's Chancellor about
      this time becomes intelligible: &ldquo;Your Lordship's Majesty's expenditure is
      exceeding revenue by 50 per cent&rdquo;; so that Beech's was soon realizing
      considerably in bonds over Europe, and Hogarth temporarily poor&mdash;had
      stubbornly refused any Parliament-grant for the Regent's personal
      establishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly from the blue fell his bolt: at that same table of the
      Regent's oath-of-office assembled eighty-seven Jewish lords and gentlemen
      at noon of the 24th March, the first day of the month Nisan in the Jewish
      year 5699, ordered, each by himself, to the Royal presence; and the
      Regent, with the gravest eyes, both palms pressed on the table, in an
      embarrassment of compunction, rose and spoke with them&mdash;Rothschild
      and merchant-prince, Chief Rabbi, Manchester Chief Minister, Heads of the
      Alliance Israélite, Anglo-Jewish Association, Jewish Board, Jewish
      philanthropists, writers; and they could not believe themselves awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by speaking of himself, the fact of his power, with such
      graciousness, that all were affected, not by the power, but by the
      gentleness which wielded it: Providence had given him the disposal of the
      earth, and it was for him to do his poor best&mdash;a lonesome, sorrowful
      post; so that talking could never alter in anything the main point; but it
      could modify details: and he had called them to invoke their great
      administrative gift and expert counsel; he told of the exodus which he
      designed, the home which he had prepared them; recommended a Sanhedrim of
      Chief Jews to form the Provisional Government of the new State, with the
      Chief Rabbi as its head under the title of Shophet (Judge); would offer a
      contribution of £ 15,000,000 from his Exchequer toward an emigration and
      colonizing fund, and doubtless emigration bureaus would be at once
      established at principal centres; he would also hand over a Deed of Gift
      of this larger Judaea as between the Sea and the Jewish people to the
      Central Authority as soon as established; also, duplicates of the text of
      the Treaty as between the Sea and the Ottoman Empire. What he gave he
      gave, he assured them, with a free heart, without condition; except, of
      course, one: that no inch of the new land should ever &ldquo;belong&rdquo; to any
      particular Jew: for he gave, as Nature gave the earth, not to a hundred,
      but to all, living and to be born, occupiers to pay rent, not to any
      adventurer calling himself landlord, but to the Central Authority,
      representing all. This done, he would invoke with confidence upon their
      able race the blessing of Almighty God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In tones so mellow did he utter himself, that for many minutes stillness
      reigned, every face pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until a baron stood up with ashen under-lip, to say that such a scheme, it
      seemed to him, must remain for ever abortive, unless enforced by Act of
      Parliament&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hogarth checked him quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my lord, not by Act of Parliament: the how your lordship may leave to
      me. I dare say you will see it in this evening's papers&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by an Order in Council!
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">

      Majesty, the Lord Regent, in Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;WHEREAS His Lordship's Majesty was pleased to declare in the name and on

      hereinafter mentioned trades, occupations, pursuits, or acts, shall be
      carried on or done within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland

    <p>
      No Jew might own or work land, or teach in any Cheder or school, or be
      entered at any Public School or University, or sign any stamped document,
      or carry on certain trades, or vote, or officiate at any public service,
      and so on: parentage, not religion, constituting a &ldquo;Jew&rdquo;. Through Britain
      this piece of Russian despotism sent a wave of quiet gladness, and an
      epidemic of jest broke out, in club, factory, &ldquo;Lane&rdquo;, and drawing-room:
      &ldquo;You hurry up&mdash;to Jericho!&rdquo; became the workman's answer to a Jew; it
      was remarked that the chimney of train and steamship would furnish a new
      pillar of cloud by day, and pillar of fire by night, to go before the
      modern Exodus; they were little to be pitied, for even Heaven was their
      mortgagor in land, with promise to pay&mdash;the Promised Land; a
      syndicate would be formed to &ldquo;pool&rdquo; milk and honey, and either Sharon or
      Salem would become the new Get-O at any price; being a rather Peculiar
      People, they would call the new Temple &ldquo;the 'Ouse&rdquo; (of Prey-ers), and make
      contango-day coincide with Passover....But let him laugh that is of a
      merry heart: as for Israel, with weary breast and hunted stare he
      sandalled his foot for the final Exodus: yet not as them without hope.
      Already&mdash;some days before the Order in Council&mdash;the
      disappearance of Estrella's body, her daring prophecies, had led to the
      embarkation of 700 Jews for Palestine; and when the Regent's Edict gave
      startling confirmation of her prediction of &ldquo;the Return&rdquo;, in many a
      million hearts thrilled the certainty: &ldquo;the Day of the Lord is nigh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that their stoicism and organizing strength, they mutely turned
      to follow the finger of Destiny: their <i>takifs</i> (rich men), hard upon
      the unchosen, were, as usual, liberal to their own, the fund swelled, and
      a Committee left England for the accumulation of stores and implements; at
      the same time two Parliament Bills were passed in two sittings, empowering
      the purchase by Government of land &ldquo;owned&rdquo; by Jews on Land Bill terms, and
      quickening the machinery for the collection of debts due to Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon, &ldquo;You see&rdquo;, said the Chief Rabbi, &ldquo;he drives us out: but he
      makes us aprons&mdash;if only of fig-leaves&mdash;to cover us. Let us bow
      to his rod, and thank him, and go: he is God's Minister&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went: the world's mercantile marine having been summoned,
      sea-ports were turned into caravansaries of gabardine and ear-lock: the
      Exodus began.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of which it came to the knowledge of the Regent that the
      house of Frankl was making ready for departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Hogarth rebelled against Heaven: self-forgetfully he did his best,
      and it returned and struck him dead: for what good, he thought, would his
      life do him, she always in Asia, he in Europe?
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote to her, a passionate hotch-potch of command and grovelling
      supplication: if she went, he would curse her; would go mad; would
      blaspheme God; would throw up everything; would die.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had promised to go down to Oxford to receive a degree, and as up to the
      time of his departure she had not replied, he went half-unconscious of
      himself and those about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, upon Adair Street the Expulsion had brought despair, the
      second-reading now assured, the Jews' vote over, and new writs issued; the
      second-reading debate was actually in progress at that date of the Oxford
      visit; and though the four yachts, copies of the <i>Mahomet II</i>, were
      being rapidly put together, the Bill, if at all pressed, must get through
      before they could be ready; nor could the House of Lords long delay its
      passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained Harris, so far ineffectual, but not therefore hopeless: so
      he, spurred, went down to Oxford.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what Harris could not do was to get near to Hogarth: his task was, as
      it were, to pluck Venus from the firmament; but he mused, he mused upon
      her, with musing astrologic eye, with grand patience, fascinated by her
      very splendours, not without hope. When at 8 P.M. a banquet was served to
      250 guests in the Radcliffe Library, the upper gallery being open to a
      crawling public to see the lions feed, Harris, watching thence the
      unattainable under the blue of the canopy&mdash;blue always in honour of
      the Sea&mdash;thought within himself: &ldquo;Ah, Mr. 76, you've got it all,
      ain't you?&mdash;for the time being. But 'ow'd you feel if I had a pistol
      now? Gawd! I can just see him nicely curl and kick. Worse luck, I can't
      shoot a bloomin' 'ouse&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the opportunity was so exquisite, that he resolved to try&mdash;the
      exit reached, would run, get a pistol, and return; but at the door itself
      a hand touched his shoulder, and, with a twist of guilty scare, he saw&mdash;O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Gawd!&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;what you want to startle anybody like that
      for? Don't you know that the wicked flea pursueth every man, but the
      righteous shall escape his filthy snare?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here, boy?&rdquo; asked O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thick-head! ain't I down 'ere after this precious Mr. 76?&rdquo;&mdash;for
      Hogarth, if Monarch of the Sun, would have remained for Harris only a
      glorified 76, Colmoor being for him the reality of the universe, all else
      mirage, such stuff as dreams are made of.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, said O'Hara, &ldquo;come with me: want to talk to you&rdquo;&mdash;he just
      come from the <i>Mahomet</i> through Spain and France, drawn to Hogarth as
      moths to a candle, his petition for pardon not yet answered; and he
      assumed that Hogarth's wrath still blazed, though, in fact, answer was
      only delayed by competition of greater interests, Hogarth having forgotten
      O'Hara; at any rate, O'Hara, with shrinking qualms, had come to Oxford,
      thinking: &ldquo;I will try and get at him for one more talk&mdash;I am not
      afraid of your eyes, my son: tut! I've seen the great brow in a
      prison-cap. And the haughty beast still loves old Pat at bottom, I do
      declare. Be bold, be bold, but not <i>too</i> bold....Well, I will! And,
      if I perish, I perish, and he perishes, too, so help me, God&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      And to Harris, walking by the towing-path, he said: &ldquo;No, boy, don't you.
      Not now. Tut!&mdash;those lords: they are only making you their tool.
      Don't you understand? Hogarth is robbing from them the land which they
      have robbed from the British people, and they naturally wish to murder
      him: but what have <i>you</i>, or I, to do with that? Let the thieves
      fight it out between them, while we enjoy ourselves, if we can. Weren't we
      happy in the <i>Mahomet</i>, boy&mdash;we two? Didn't you roll whole weeks
      drunk? That was better than Colmoor, eh, Alfie? And didn't I have my
      incense, my grapes, my little Circassian, and ten thousand pounds in
      yellow gold a year? Wasn't that all right? Well, we may have it again!&mdash;not
      in the <i>Mahomet</i>, perhaps, but somewhere. Do nothing&mdash;not yet:
      till I give the word. If you <i>must</i> kill, get a dog, or a horse, or
      an obscure old man, not the Regent of England&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dirty old swine!&rdquo; cried Harris, angry, &ldquo;'aven't I forbid you again and
      again from making game of me? You're doing it now! You just try that on,
      and go up thou bald-head, it <i>is</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But is this understood between us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old duffer! you are one thing to-day, and another thing to-morrow:
      there's no knowing how to tyke you. You're such a sinful old 'ypocrite,
      that you play-act before yourself, I do believe. What is it you do mean?
      You myke anyone sick of you; your incense and your burnt sacrifices are an
      offence unto me. This Mr. 76 once put a knife into me, and I mean to put
      another into him: 'ow's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Ow about your sweet friend, Frankl? I'm under contract with him, ain't
      I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better put the knife into Frankl&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Into the pair of you, it strikes me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you make the least attempt upon Hogarth now, you get not another
      shilling&mdash;&ldquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bah! shut that&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the threat won sullen consent; and when after the Banquet the Oxford
      guests had driven to see the illuminations, spoiled by boisterous
      Spring-winds, and when the Regent returned to his chambers, he caught
      sight of O'Hara amid the throng that lined the stair; upon which, after
      stepping up past, he stopped, twisted round, to say: &ldquo;You, Admiral
      Donald?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I might speak ten minutes with your Lordship's Majesty&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Those bold eyes of O'Hara dropped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, said the Regent, &ldquo;I will see. Come to-morrow&mdash;about five,&rdquo;
       and went on up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the Degree was conferred in the theatre, Doctor of Common
      Law&mdash;&ldquo;an appropriate one&rdquo;, the Master of Balliol remarked, &ldquo;though
      'Surgeon' would perhaps be the <i>mot juste</i>&rdquo;; and thus at last Hogarth
      donned cap-and-tassel, though not Frankl's&mdash;a livery which drew from
      Harris the reflection: &ldquo;Sweet beauty!&mdash;in his mortarboard&rdquo;. The nip
      upon the brow of the college-cap peak resembled the nip of the Scotch
      prison-cap, awaking memories: but the symbolism was different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, the Regent's eye wandered, madness and folly in his heart, and
      fear, till at four a letter came, he having left Loveday at Buckingham
      Palace with instructions to open letters and send the One.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had written:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you can expect of me I am unable to conceive. Have you not expelled
      me? Let us be worthy of our long friendship, and 'play the man'....'My
      exaltation to afflictions high'....With prayers for you, I say good-bye:
      and will remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;REBEKAH FRANKL&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loveday had added: &ldquo;She left London at noon for Southampton. Purchas
      followed to spy. Machray's other detective waits in Palace for
      instructions&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the dinner in Christ Church Hall, and the Ball, which were to end
      the program of this last day, at four-thirty the news spread that the
      Regent had been taken ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you not expelled me?&rdquo;...Was she angry? Did <i>she</i> not know that
      he meant well? Hogarth, breaking into a rage, leapt up, with, &ldquo;I swear to
      God that not one step does she move out of this country&mdash;!&rdquo; and
      rushed to a bell: a gentleman-usher came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All will be ready in fifteen minutes, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel bad: say ten minutes; tell the Lord Chamberlain&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I might mention&mdash;did your Lordship's Majesty grant a ten
      minutes' audience to Admiral Donald for this hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Who</i>? Yes, I think&mdash;Just kick him down the stairs! Or no&mdash;say
      I may see him some day&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      This message, as the usher dashed through, was faithfully dropped at
      O'Hara's consciousness; and O'Hara said: &ldquo;Hoity-toity...!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bent-backed he descended to the Quadrangle, with a sense of defeat,
      rebuff, contumely, rage, but quite sprightly said to Harris, waiting
      beyond the Gateway: &ldquo;Well, boy, how can we make a night of it? I feel that
      way&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seen Mr. 76?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, no. Sharpen up that knife for his throat, boy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Harris exclaimed: &ldquo;Another chynge! Strike me silly!&mdash;what did I
      sye? Give me a new 'eart, O Lawd, it <i>is</i>&mdash;you grey-haired old
      duffer. Chopping and chynging, always the syme&mdash;to your old wife
      Jyne. I'd be ashamed of myself in your plyce. But sharpen up the knife, it
      <i>is</i>&rdquo;.

    <h2>
      XLVII. &mdash; THE EMIGRANTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Late the same night the Regent received at the Palace a telegram about
      Rebekah: She had travelled alone to Southampton, where a landau at the
      station had awaited her, in which she had driven to a country-house near
      the Itchen named &ldquo;Silverfern&rdquo;, two miles from Bitterne Manor, in which
      lived an elderly gentleman, Mr. Abrahams, ark-opener and scroll-bearer in
      the Synagogue, with his wife and two sons. The passage of these, and of
      Rebekah, was booked by the <i>Calabria</i>, Jewish emigrant-ship, to sail
      in four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth no sooner heard these tidings than he tumbled into crime: resolved
      to kidnap Rebekah; to break his own law for his own behoof: one of the
      basest acts of a King.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had four days: and by the end of the second four men lay in wait round
      &ldquo;Silverfern&rdquo;, one a sea-fort sub-lieutenant, one a detective, and two
      others very rough customers: a cottage having been hired by them for the
      reception of Rebekah in a dell a mile higher up the Itchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But something infects the world; and gravity badgers the bullet's
      trajectory; and a magnetic &ldquo;H&rdquo; disturbs the needle; and &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; roots
      turn up in the equation; and the finger of God is in every pie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence, though the four ravishers lay in wait, and actually effected a
      seizure, the Regent did not get his girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the four had ever seen her: but as there was no young lady except
      her at &ldquo;Silverfern&rdquo;, that seemed of no importance, so she had been only
      described to them as dark and pretty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the night after Rebekah's arrival, there came to &ldquo;Silverfern&rdquo; a new
      inmate: Margaret Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Her</i> passage, too, was booked to Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Frankl had said: &ldquo;In expelling the Jews, he shall expel his own
      sister. Oh, that's sweet, after all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time Frankl's interest in Land Bill and England was dead, two
      interests only remaining to him: so to realize his share in the Western
      world as to reach Jerusalem loaded with wealth; and also, not less
      intense, to hurt Hogarth, to outwit him, to cry quits at the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was hard&mdash;Hogarth being set so high; but he invoked the help of
      the Holy One (blessed be He): and was not without resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why had Hogarth never had him seized, racked? What restrained the Regent
      <i>now</i>? That was a question with Frankl. Hogarth might say, even to
      himself, that Frankl was vermin too small to be crushed, that he waited
      for his sister from God; but lately the real reason had grown upon Frankl:
      it was because Hogarth <i>was afraid</i> of him! afraid that Frankl, if
      persecuted beyond measure, might blurt out the Regent's convict past, and
      raise a sensation of horror through the world not pleasant to face.
      Harris, O'Hara, Rebekah and Frankl alone knew that past, and the motives
      for silence of the first three were obvious; nor had Frankl whispered that
      secret even to his own heart in his bed-chamber, conscious of his own
      guilt in the matter of the Arab Jew's death, fearing that, if the wit and
      power of Hogarth were given motive to move heaven and earth, the real
      facts might not be undiscoverable: then would Frankl be ground to fine
      powder by the grinders. But if he was going to Palestine, what mattered?
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, there was Margaret: she should go out as a Jewess.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived at &ldquo;Silverfern&rdquo; in the charge of a Jewish clerk, and the
      Abrahams received her as an afflicted orphan, committed to Frankl by her
      father; she, like Rebekah, to go under their care.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the evening before the departure, Mr. and Mrs. Abrahams, their two
      sons, Rebekah and Margaret, all go for a stroll&mdash;about nine o'clock,
      that morning one of the four ravishers having been to the house on some
      pretence, seen Margaret with Mrs. Abrahams under the porch, and noted her
      well, her grey tailor-gown, her brooch, her singing; and now, as all
      walked out under the moon, they were watched, the watchers, surprised at
      the presence of <i>two</i> young ladies, concluding that the smaller&mdash;Rebekah&mdash;must
      have arrived later: so upon the large and shapely form of Margaret their
      gaze fastened, as the party passed near their hedge of concealment,
      Margaret then remarking: &ldquo;My name is Rachel Oppenheimer&mdash;&rdquo; and Mrs.
      Abrahams with gentle chiding answering her: &ldquo;No, be good: your name is
      Ruth Levi&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      For during two years at the Jewish Asylum at Wroxham they had tilled into
      her shrieking brain, &ldquo;Now, be good: your name is Rachel Oppenheimer&rdquo;, and
      one day she had said: &ldquo;My name <i>is</i> Rachel Oppenheimer&rdquo;, and had been
      saying it ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, there was a real Rachel Oppenheimer, a dependent of Frankl's, at
      Yarmouth, who was rather mad, and when it had been necessary that Margaret
      should be out of the way in order to secure Hogarth's conviction, two
      doctors had examined this Rachel Oppenheimer, and given the legal
      certificates by means of which Frankl had put away Margaret; and she
      during two years of sanity in an atmosphere of lunacy had screamed for
      pity, till one morning she had shewed the stare, the unworldly rapture,
      and had started to sing her old songs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After which, Frankl, hearing of it, and touched by some awe, had got her
      out, and kept her in one retreat or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in all her madness was mixed some memory of his devilish heart, and
      every fresh sight of him inspired her with panic, she in his presence
      hanging upon his eyes, instant to obey his slightest hint: hence her
      beckoning down to Hogarth from that window in Market Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, on this last night of England the Abrahams party strolled far, two
      days like Summer days having come, on hedge and tree now tripping the
      shoots of Spring, the moon-haunted night of a mild mood: so from
      &ldquo;Silverfern&rdquo; lawns they passed up a steep field northward, down a path
      between village-houses, and idled within a pine-wood by the river-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon's glow was like one luminous ghost: and buttercup, daisy,
      snowdrop, primrose gathered Margaret, vagrant, flighty, light to the winds
      that wafted her as fluff, and tossed them suddenly aloft, and back they
      came to be tangled in her bare hair; and now she was a tipsy bacchante,
      singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Will you come to the wedding?
  Will you come?
  Bring you own bread and butter,
  And your own tea and sugar,
  And we'll all pay a penny for the Rum&rdquo;.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Ruth!&rdquo;&mdash;from Rebekah, an arm about her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is such a huge pool which is wheeling&rdquo;, said Margaret, gazing at it
      with surprise, &ldquo;and it goes hollow in the middle: my goodness, it does
      wheel! and there is a little grey duck in it ranging round and round with
      it, and this little grey duck is singing like an angel&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know where we are going to?&rdquo; asked Rebekah: &ldquo;to the land of our
      fathers, Ruth, after all the exile in this ugly Western world; and it is
      he who sends us, the fierce-willed master of men&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name&rdquo;, said Margaret, &ldquo;is Rachel Oppenheimer&rdquo;; and immediately, wafted
      like a half-inflated balloon which leaps to descend a thousand feet away,
      she sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Happy day! Happy day!
  When Jesus washed my sins away...&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Then, woe-begone, she shook her head, and let fall her abandoned hand; and
      Rebekah, speaking more to herself: &ldquo;Did you never hear of Hogarth, the
      King, Ruth? or see him in some dream in shining white, with a face like
      the face in the bush which burned and was not consumed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now Margaret laughed, crying out: &ldquo;Oh, there's a man riding a
      shorthorn bull that has wings; white it is: and up they fly, the bull
      pawing and snorting, all among the stars. Oh, and now the man is falling!&mdash;my
      goodness&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood still, gazing at that thing in heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what has become of the man, dear?&rdquo; asked Rebekah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't make out....But I should like to marry that man&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, if wishes were fathers, we should all have babies, Ruth, to say our
      <i>kaddish</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, look&mdash;!&rdquo; cried Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rabbit had rushed across a path ahead, and she ran that way beyond a
      bend....When Rebekah followed she had disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Rebekah's outcry all set to search wood, path, river&mdash;she was
      gone; but after five minutes a voice a long way off in the wood, singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;O what a pretty place,
  And what a graceful city....&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      on which the two youths flew toward the sound, and presently the rest,
      following, heard a shout, a cry, then silence, till one of the young men
      came running back, his face washed in blood: he had seen some forms, and,
      as he had approached, been struck on the brow, his brother felled. When
      all came to where the brother lay insensible, no sign of Margaret; nor
      could villagers and police, searching through the night, find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone without surprise with her four captors, who had carried her
      to a cottage of boarded-up windows: and the same hour Hogarth had the
      news.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the four received detailed instructions at the village <i>poste
      restante</i>: the lady-attendant at the cottage was to ask the prisoner if
      she would go to London, try to persuade her, and, if she consented, make
      her sign pledge of honour (enclosed) to go without any attempt at escape
      during three days.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were surprised: for that Margaret was deranged they had seen at
      once, and supposed that the Regent must know it: what, then, could her
      pledge do? Their business, however, was to obey: and when Margaret was
      asked: &ldquo;Will you go quietly to the Palace in London with us?&rdquo; she
      answered: &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Here we go to London-town:
  Tri-de-laddie! Tri-de-laddie!
  See the King with his golden crown,
   Tri-de-laddie, O!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      By noon the Abrahams and Rebekah were being tugged out of harbour, to the
      hand-wavings and god-speeds of seven emigrant-boats by the quay; but it
      was not till five that the Regent's emissaries could obtain a special
      train on the thronged lines; and not till after seven did they arrive with
      Margaret at the Palace-gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, that night the Lord Regent and the Prince of Wales were attending a
      banquet at the Guildhall, given in honour of sea-rent reduction on British
      ships, and at the moment when Margaret arrived Hogarth, already <i>en
      route</i>, thinking of Rebekah, muttered: &ldquo;By now she is here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But since Frankl, on getting news of the disappearance of Margaret, had at
      once conjectured the hand of Hogarth, as Margaret was being handed from
      the cab at the Palace-gates, she saw two terrible eyes, and, snatching her
      hand free, flew screaming down the street&mdash;eyes of Frankl, who,
      conjecturing that hither she would be brought, had taken stand there half
      the afternoon, knowing precisely the effect upon her of the sight of his
      face; and said he: &ldquo;You see, you haven't got her yet&mdash;though you <i>shall</i>
      have her to your heart's content....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she could only run southward or northward, he had posted two
      motor-cars, one containing a clerk to south, the other Harris, to north,
      so that, as she ran, one or other should catch her, hustle her in, and
      dash away.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, she ran north, right into the arms of Harris, her surprised
      guardians still ten yards behind; and &ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; hissed Harris, &ldquo;come with
      me, or 'e'll 'ave you!&rdquo; and was off with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon which Frankl drove to the Market Street house, where he found Harris
      and Margaret; and again, with screams, she sought to fly, though her first
      terrors gave place to a quiet subservience after some minutes of his
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Lawd!&rdquo; said Harris, &ldquo;she started singing in the car, you know. Sing me
      songs of Araby, it <i>is</i>. Enough to give anybody the sicks&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see this gentleman here?&rdquo; said Frankl to Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, she whispered: &ldquo;oh my!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it so happens that very likely you are going to live in the same
      house as him&mdash;a big Palace with all gold and silver, where the King
      with his crown lives, and all. So while you are there, I want you to be
      his friend as if it was myself, and do everything he tells you, same as
      myself, in fact. Do you see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, she whispered, her large form towering above Frankl's, yet awe of
      him widening her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your name?&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Rachel Oppenheimer&rdquo;, said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right: come up and dress&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him up to a back room, where was a lamp, a glass, etc., and
      on an old settee evening-dress complete, shoes, roses, head-wrap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now&rdquo;, said Frankl, leaving her, he, too, in evening-dress, &ldquo;I give you
      ten minutes to rig yourself out in that lot: a second more, and you catch
      it&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in fifteen minutes they two were in a cab, <i>en route</i> for the
      Guildhall, Frankl, who had invitations for himself and daughter, saying:
      &ldquo;You understand? you keep your eye fixed upon me the whole time&mdash;never
      mind about eating&mdash;and when I hold up my finger <i>so</i>, you rise
      and give them a little song....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a function intended to be memorable, the Lord Regent going in
      state, attended by 150 Yeomen, King-at-Arms, six heralds and all Heralds'
      College, to be met at Temple Bar by my Lord Mayor, that day made a
      baronet, with his Sheriffs and Aldermen on horseback; the Guildhall in
      blue velvet, the platform at the east end bearing rows of squat gold
      chairs, while a canopy of deep-blue velvet, lined with light-blue
      sarcenet, dropped ponderous draperies, tied back with gold ropes, over the
      floor; on the canopy-front being Sword and Sceptre, the Royal Crown of
      Britain, and the Diadem of the Sea; the canopy table and the other looking
      like a short and a long wine-banquet of the Magi in Ophir: present being
      members of the British Royal House, Ambassadors to Britain and the Sea,
      the two Archbishops, Ministers, the Speaker, Officers, Fort-Admirals, the
      Regent's Household, the chief Nobility, the City personages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farthest from the short royal table, near the foot of the long, where the
      dishes were <i>kosher</i> for a Jewish colony, sat Frankl, and opposite
      him Margaret; and that face of Frankl was pinched and worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He prayed continually: &ldquo;May God be my Rock and my High Tower; may the
      Almighty be my Shield this night....&rdquo; while in two minutes Margaret had
      begun to be a wonder to her neighbours&mdash;heaved sighs, threw herself,
      beat plate with knife, hummed a little, yet conscious of wrong-doing, her
      eyes fixed upon Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; her sigh heaved mortally, head tumbling dead on shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you&mdash;unwell?&rdquo; asked a startled neighbour, all shirt-front,
      eye-glass and delicacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see a long table with gold plates&rdquo;, she whined pitifully, &ldquo;on every
      plate an eyeball dying....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frankl controlled her with a glance of anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the second course after turtle, with a fainting prayer to Jehovah,
      the Jew clandestinely held up a forefinger; upon which she, after some
      hesitation, remembered the signal, and like a dart shot to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now every eye fastened upon her, from Regent's and Prince's to the bottom,
      those near her, who knew her now, feeling a miserable heart-shrinking of
      shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      With sideward head she stood some seconds, smiling; and she sighed: &ldquo;My
      name is Rachel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But soon, her mood now rushing into sprightliness, she stamped, and with
      an active alacrity of eye, sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Will you come to the wedding?
  Will you come?
  Bring your own bread-and-butter,
  And your own tea-and-sugar,
  And we'll all pay a penny for the Rum,
  Rum, Rum,
  We'll all pay a penny for the Rum&rdquo;.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Regent had risen, while Frankl, calm now in reaction, gazed sweetly
      upon his face: the vengeance of a Jew&mdash;nor was he half done with
      vengeance. Certainly, Hogarth was pale: he had sought her long, and found
      her <i>so</i>. &ldquo;Why it is my own heart&rdquo;, he thought, &ldquo;and they have made
      her mad&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      One moment a stab of shame pierced him at the reflection: &ldquo;<i>Here!</i>&rdquo;
       but in the next his heart yearned upon her, and he rose nimbly and
      naturally far beyond Lord Mayor and Prince, and the rut of the world.
      After a perfectly deliberate bow, he left his place, and walked down the
      length of the hall to her, amid the gaping gods, Loveday, too, and three
      others, when he was half-way, following.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had her hand, touched her temple lightly, yet compellingly,
      healingly....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, don't you know me?&mdash;Richard?&mdash;<i>Dick?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, but at sight of Loveday some kind of recognition seemed to light, and
      die, in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you come, dear, and sit up yonder with me?&rdquo; Hogarth asked, his face
      a mask of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wearily she shook her head; and &ldquo;John&rdquo;, said Hogarth, &ldquo;take her home&rdquo;;
      whereupon Loveday led her out, the Regent returning to the canopy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later he found it <i>à propos</i> of something to say to the
      Prince: &ldquo;That lady who sang is my sister, Your Royal Highness&mdash;seems
      to have been subjected to gross cruelties, and has gone crazy&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning everyone knew that she was the Regent's sister; and a man
      said to a man: &ldquo;There is madness in the family, then....&rdquo;

      XLVIII. &mdash; THE SEA-FORTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The second-reading of the Land Bill had passed by a 59 majority: and it
      would now have been easy work to hurry through its remaining stages in a
      couple of weeks; but the Regent had awaited the nation's verdict in the
      return of the 120 to fill the Jewish seats, sure of the result.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the 23rd was a great night&mdash;the third-reading&mdash;the majority
      115 at 8 P.M.; and the next day, which was marked by a very brilliant
      levée, the Bill was before the Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stage it might easily have reached four weeks before, but had been
      shelved for the election of the 120: and in those weeks the four copies of
      the <i>Mahomet II</i>. had been launched.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly&mdash;bad news from Palestine: news that there, too, after
      all the safeguards, the greed of a few was working to plant the old
      European wrong: for, the Sanhedrim being short of funds for a railway, a
      syndicate of five merchant-princes had offered to buy from it an estate
      between Jerusalem and the Jordan, and when the Chief Rabbi had pointed out
      that the offer was monstrous, in view of the terms of the Sea's Deed of
      Gift, a fierce discussion had ensued, a schism; and although the
      syndicate's offer had been rejected by 27, at the next session the
      defeated leader, like some warlike Maccabæus, had surged with his faction
      and a hundred Arabs into the Mosque of Omar where the Sanhedrim met, to
      cast those who did not escape by flight into prison in the Pasha's Palace.
      In the hands of his clique the Government remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the news....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was followed in three days by a Representation to the Regent, signed by
      90,000 Jews in Palestine, the fourth name being Rebekah Frankl's, they
      imploring him for their sinking ship just launched, calling him &ldquo;Father&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      For though the Jews had been content to see that Europe which they
      contemned parcelled out among a few, while the mass of men hovered
      countryless&mdash;from this had arisen their lucre&mdash;their mental
      quality was too rich in business shrewdness to tolerate in their own case
      any such Bedlam: yet they stood helpless before the disaster, and only in
      the Regent was hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that night of the arrival of their Petition, the Prime Minister and the
      Commander-in-Chief dined in the Palace, placid men at the moment when soup
      began, the Regent's sky quite clear, for, though a rumour whispered that
      the Lords were designedly lengthening discussion of the Bill, this gave no
      one any concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      During entremêts, however, a scribbled card was passed into the hand of
      the Commander-in-Chief, and, as he read, his eyebrows lifted. Craving
      permission, he hurried out, had some talk with his Director of Military
      Intelligence, and returned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, as they three sat on a balcony overlooking the lake, with
      cigars, the Regent said: &ldquo;I have thought, Sir Robert Wortley, of sending
      out at once two thousand Tommies under, say, General Sir John Clough, to
      the help of those poor Jews....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Commander-in-Chief cleared his throat, and in a strained voice
      interfered: &ldquo;That is, my Lord King, if we ourselves have not need of every
      soldier of the line within the next week&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Regent deposited his ash with peering eyes, puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your Lordship mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Lordship's Majesty, I was summoned from dinner just now to talk with
      Major-General Sir Maurice Coppleston, who reports movements of armed men,
      just come to his knowledge, and now going forward on a considerable scale,
      all northward. He gathers that these can only consist of Territorials and
      Yeomanry Cavalry, of whom not less than twelve battalions of rifles and
      three batteries of artillery, officers and men, are now on the way to, or
      massed upon, York. How widely the movement may actually extend&mdash;God
      knows&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Silence now: Sir Robert Wortley suddenly whitening to the lips. Then
      Hogarth, in a very low voice, said: &ldquo;They do not know me&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I may crave leave to retire at once&mdash;&rdquo; from the
      Commander-in-Chief; and Hogarth gave consent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Queer things, omens, doubtings, weird clouds, gathered about Hogarth that
      night. When at eleven he gave audience to Admiral Quilter-Beckett, arrived
      from the <i>Boodah</i> Quilter-Beckett said: &ldquo;Strange the fine weather
      here: at sea it is quite rough, the <i>Boodah</i> well under foam, and
      that old <i>Campania</i> pitches so&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have come, then, in the <i>Campania</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;from Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what about the yacht?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the yacht: in her I have sent the two hundred men to the <i>Mahomet</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Which</i> two hundred men, Admiral?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quilter-Beckett stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Lordship's Majesty has forgotten: I had instructions that you
      desired some interchanges among the garrisons, and had ordered the sending
      of two hundred of my men to the <i>Mahomet</i>, I to receive in return two
      hundred from her&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you have sent your two hundred?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you received the two hundred from the <i>Mahomet?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They had not arrived when I left the <i>Boodah</i>&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that you left only one hundred men in the <i>Boodah</i>, with
      instructions to receive two hundred others?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is so, my Lord King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But suppose I tell you that I have given no such instructions: will your
      heart&mdash;<i>leap?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hogarth clapped a sudden hand of horror upon Quilter-Beckett's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God&mdash;!&rdquo; Quilter-Beckett started like a gun's recoil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be calm, Admiral: it may be only some mistake....From whence had you this
      order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From&mdash;from the <i>Mahomet</i>, in the usual course&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good night, Admiral; I would be alone&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that very hour a world-tragedy was being enacted over the dark and
      turbulent ocean, and the immensest of Empires was sinking into the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darkly, quietly, with no mighty and multitudinous tumult of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      That midnight the night-glass of many a mystified merchantman searched the
      murk for those coruscations with which the crescent of forts had
      constellated the Atlantic, the mariner's sea-rent waiting ready, with his
      ship's-papers, in his cash box: but no galaxy of lights glanced that
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some, before this, they had appeared, but, as the ship approached, had
      vanished, and it was as though the swarm of the Pleiades had been caught
      from the skies before their eyes. Long before dawn ships separated by
      three thousand miles had gained the assurance that this or that sea-fort
      no longer rode the familiar spot-had been rapt to the stars, had sunk, had
      somehow passed from being. Before this monstrous marvel the mariner stood
      dumb, and it was afterwards said that that wild night the terminals of
      heaven and earth were lost, that the storm-winds were haunted, in all the
      air lamentation, sobbings as for swallowed orbs, and the whisper: &ldquo;It is
      finished&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days previously a telegram from Admiral O'Hara had gone to all the
      forts in European waters, commanding an interchange of 200 of their men
      with men of his own fort; and each officer in command, ignorant that the
      same instructions had gone to others, had complied: so that by the next
      morning, the 29th April, 1600 men from eight forts were converging in
      yachts upon the <i>Mahomet</i>. As the fort garrisons, originally
      numbering 500, had recently been reduced to 300, the others having been
      mostly drafted into the 2nd Division of the British Royal Marines,
      compliance with Admiral O'Hara's order left a garrison of 100 only at each
      of eight forts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward five in the afternoon of that day, the 29th, 700 men, to the
      bewilderment of her officers, were in the <i>Mahomet</i> two of the
      fort-yachts having arrived upon a troubled First Lieutenant who was in
      command, all attempts to see the Admiral since the morning having failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But near seven the Admiral summoned the Treasurer to his <i>bureau</i>
      near the bottom, he being in dressing-gown and slippers, very slovenly,
      seeming either drunk or sick, his mouth gaping to his pantings, and anon
      his languishing eye shot dyingly to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see how I am, Mr. Treasurer&rdquo;, he went, &ldquo;seedy. Pain in this
      temple, trouble with the respiration, and a foul breath. Poor Admiral
      Donald, Mr. Treasurer, poor Admiral Donald. The fashion of this world
      passeth away, sir, and the Will of God be done! Sometimes, I pledge you my
      word, I almost wish that I was dead. There are things, sir, in this world&mdash;Ah,
      well, God help me; I feel very chippy. I wanted to ask you, sir, to let me
      see the books, and hand me over at once all unaudited and unsettled funds
      in your counting-house, though I'm not fit for affairs to-day, sir, God
      knows&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; cried the Treasurer, a hard-browed, bald-headed man with a
      fan-beard, savouring of banks and ledgers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just pass them over, sir&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, this is the most singular order I ever heard of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Obey me promptly, sir, or, by God, I cashier you!&rdquo; roared O'Hara, his
      raised lids laying nude the debauchery of those jaundiced juicy balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it so, Admiral Donald&rdquo;&mdash;the Treasurer bowed: &ldquo;but on the
      understanding that I formally protest against the irregularity, and report
      it to the High Chancellor&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      He retired, and in half an hour returned with two clerks who bore books,
      himself a carpet-bag containing in cash-boxes £850,000, paper and gold,
      which he deposited on the Admiral's <i>bureau</i>, and, after again
      protesting before the clerks, went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far off by now were some of the other six fort-yachts, converging with
      their 200 upon the <i>Mahomet</i>, and as the Admiral had no intention of
      being put into irons as a lunatic in his own fort, at eight o'clock he
      stole from his apartments, dressed now, not in uniform, but in priest's
      robes and a voluminous cloak, bearing in one hand the bag, in the other a
      key.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those lower depths of the <i>Mahomet</i> were an utter solitude, lit with
      rare rays; yet the Admiral journeyed through and up peering, skulking,
      pausing, hurrying, and, if by chance a light caught his face, it showed a
      horror of convulsive flesh, his body a mass of trembling, like jelly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the forts had been built to fight; and (since nothing is impossible),
      if they fought, they might fall into an enemy's hand: to obviate which,
      there was in a little room on the third floor a handle which opened by
      hydraulics a door in the fort's side on the fifth floor below, the
      existence of this room being unknown save to each Admiral and to four of
      his lieutenants, and its key kept in a spot known to these. This key
      O'Hara now had in hand; and as he pushed it into the lock, his jaw
      jabbered like a baboon's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night was now come; the sea rough; Spain lost to sight; the two emptied
      yachts on the way back to their forts; yonder the lights of the <i>Mahomet
      II</i>. lying-to; two officers in oilskins walking arm in arm, to and fro,
      on the roof; and said one: &ldquo;Look at those waves there all of a sudden:
      they rather seem to be breaking on the wrong side of us&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they resumed their talk; and to and fro they walked, arm in arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till now one with sudden hiss: &ldquo;But-good Christ-just look-why, the roof's
      <i>leaning</i>&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At that moment an outcry and runners from below, shouts, a trumpet-call,
      were borne on the winds to them: for the Admiral had rushed up to the
      manned parts of the fort, all hell alight in his eyeballs, bawling out,
      &ldquo;The boats! The <i>Mahomet</i> is sinking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In spite of which many perished, the survivors afterwards declaring that
      the tragedy mesmerized their nerves with a certain awe not to be compared
      with the terrors felt on sinking ships, the <i>Mahomet</i> affecting them
      like a being of life, like behemoth slowly dying, or some doomed moon. She
      gave them, indeed, plenty of time, though when the steel portals on two of
      her sides were opened, the sea washed up the steps, making the launching
      very delicate feats, and near the last the leaning was so marked, that
      there was difficulty in standing; and still in patient distress she waited
      while the waves like multitudinous wolves, trooped to prey upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Admiral ran to the outer Collector's Office to embark, he was faced
      by the Treasurer, revolver in hand, and &ldquo;Hand me over that bag, Admiral&rdquo;,
      he said pretty coolly, &ldquo;or I blow out your brains&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara's mouth worked: he could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; said the Treasurer: &ldquo;no doubt you mean to hand it over to the
      proper authorities, but I prefer to do that myself. Be quick, you old
      dog!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whereat O'Hara, having no weapon, dropped the bag, and trotted wide-eyed
      forward to the thronged scene of the launchings.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were more than enough boats, and though on the lowest side of the
      fort nothing could long be done, all had gone off, when the fort, having
      settled very low, looking for some time like a brawling cauldron and area
      of breaking waves coloured by her hundred lights, went down, and was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon the yacht, over a hundred yards away, was caught in the traction
      of her strong enthralment, and, like a planet, started into running round
      a region of sea which wheeled; while seven of the boats, rowing for life,
      were grasped, and dragged back, with a hundred and nine, into the deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Toll for the brave....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As to the other boats, they arrived at Tarifa the following evening, with
      583; but the Admiral ordered the <i>Mahomet II</i>. to Cadiz, where soon
      after midnight he landed, and, by negotiation with a &ldquo;<i>Jefe</i>&rdquo;, in an
      hour had a train for Madrid. As he was about to step in, the Treasurer
      touched his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, Admiral, off by land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, as you know&rdquo;, said O'Hara, &ldquo;for you have been spying my
      movements for the last hour. How childish to imagine that I have anything
      to fear, or want to escape! Why, I am bound for England&mdash;my only
      object in the land journey being quickness. I even invite you to come with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Admiral, I will....If you be tempted to murder me <i>en route</i>,
      remember these&rdquo;&mdash;a pair of pistols; and they set out at about the
      hour when the whole crescent of tragedies was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six that evening a yacht, a copy of the <i>Mahomet II</i>., had come to
      the Cattegat sea-fort to land 200 men who wore the Empire's blue-jacket,
      the name &ldquo;Mahomet&rdquo; on their caps&mdash;nothing to show that they were not
      genuine Mahomet men, though some looked rather sea-sick; but in reality
      they were young lords, stock-brokers, Territorial Officers,
      men-about-town, park-keepers, undergraduates, secretly armed with knife
      and revolver, and knowing, too, where the armoury of the sea-fort lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, three other yachts, all named <i>Mahomet II</i>., were a-ply in
      the Atlantic, two containing 400 men each, one 600, each of the first two
      to land 200 at a fort at six, and her remaining 200 at the next fort by
      eight-thirty, serving four forts, the last to land 200 at each of three
      forts: so that by 10.30 P.M. each of eight forts, including the Cattegat,
      contained 200 enemies disguised as fort-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      And punctually at eleven, in each, began perhaps the darkest massacre of
      history&mdash;no quarter given&mdash;and when the alarm went forth,
      whichever of the unarmed fort-men rushed to the dark armoury found the
      door fastened against him. Of two men in bed, talking together through an
      open door, one arose at the stroke of a clock and killed the other; some
      perished in sleep&mdash;all very quietly accomplished: a few shots, a few
      lost echoes in the vast castles, a few daubs of blood. And in no case did
      a single one, either massacred or assassin, escape alive: for, in every
      case, some one or other of the fort-officers&mdash;Admiral, Lieutenant,
      Commander&mdash;to prevent capture, opened the inlet to the flood in the
      very thick of the doom, went down with his muteness and his bubbling, and
      the sea, a secret in its bosom, rolled over the Sea.

    <h2>
      XLIX. &mdash; THE DÉBÂCLE
    </h2>
    <p>
      All the next day, till near 9 P.M., not one syllable was definitely known
      of this tremendous fact by anyone in Britain: for though, early astir, the
      Regent telegraphed the <i>Mahomet</i>, all day he waited without reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eleven the Prime Minister said to him: &ldquo;Things, my Lord King, wear at
      this moment an aspect so threatening, that I see no escape from civil war,
      even if it be brief, except by the immediate forcing through of the Bill,
      and I stand ready&mdash;now&mdash;to propose you as new peers&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait&rdquo;, answered the Regent: &ldquo;pass to-night the Bill should, but I think I
      shall effect that by myself going to the Lords, and listening a little to
      the talk&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dark day, with an under-thought always, whatever the business, of one
      thing&mdash;the Sea....
    </p>
    <p>
      About 5.30, as was his custom, he went up a stair to pass along two
      corridors to the little cream suite in which lived Margaret, for whom the
      doctors now promised sanity, her forehead daily seeming to drink-in peace
      from the contact of his palm, after which she would comb his hair, he
      lying on a sofa, or taking tea; and, &ldquo;Well, dear&rdquo;, he said, this last day
      of all, as her ladies retired to an inner salon, &ldquo;how is the head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have seen you before&rdquo;, she replied: &ldquo;what is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick Hogarth. Come to me, and let me lay my heavy head on you. The heart
      of your friend bodes to-day, bodes, bodes; but is not afraid: a tough
      heart, Madge. Do you like me to press my hand upon your head like that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, weary of his moaning heart that moaned that day like choruses of
      haunted winds through desolate halls, he fell to sleep even as he mumbled
      to her, she, seated near his sofa, playing with his hair, his arm around
      her, faint zephyrs from the window fanning his head, waving down the
      valenciennes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now she tossed the comb away, hummed, became restless, disengaged her
      shoulders, rose, strayed listlessly, with sighs, and on finding herself in
      the ante-chamber, opened the door, went out into a corridor, leant her
      back, eyeing the floor; and next with a great sigh set to gazing upward,
      droning two notes, one <i>doh</i>, one <i>soh</i>. All was silent. But now
      a sound of voices that drew her, she moving into another longer corridor,
      with balusters which overlooked a hall below, and yonder at the stair-foot
      were two men in altercation, one a guard, to whom the other was saying
      &ldquo;But I tell you the lydy herself arst me to go to her; it's an
      appointment, just like any other appointment. Do let a fellow pass!&rdquo; and
      with mouth at ear he added: &ldquo;<i>It's an affair of the 'eart! 'Ere's a sov&mdash;</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't, my friend, couldn't&rdquo;, the guardsman said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now Harris: &ldquo;Why, there she is 'erself, so 'elp-! come out to meet me,
      as the Lord liveth!&rdquo;&mdash;ran then toward where she looked over to send
      up the hoarse whisper: &ldquo;I sye&mdash;didn't you tell me yourself to come&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On which she nodded amiably, smiling, touching a rose in her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are! What more do you want?&rdquo; he said to the guard, who now gave
      him passage: and like a dart he darted, like a freed lark, or unleashed
      hound, fleet on the feet, with lifted brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sye!&rdquo; he whispered her, all active, brisk as a cat, ecstatic&mdash;&ldquo;where's
      'e?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;&mdash;she still at her rose, a memory straying in her that here was
      a friend, whom the Terrible One had bid her obey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr.&mdash;the Regent&rdquo;, he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know him. What is your name? <i>My</i> name is&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you muddle-headed cat! Don't you know the dark man with the black
      moles&mdash;quick!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Sh-h-h</i>&mdash;he is sleeping&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gawd! is he though? Come, show me! I've got a old appointment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She led the way: the two corridors&mdash;the door&mdash;the room, he
      treading on air, brow up, eyes on fire, knife bright and ready; and eight
      feet from the couch she put out her forefinger, pointing, smiling,
      Hogarth's face toward them, his mouth pouting in sleep, bosom breathing, a
      breeze in his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the lips of Harris, in the faintest snake-hiss, proceeded, &ldquo;Sleep, my
      little one-sleep, my pretty one&mdash;<i>sleep</i>&mdash;&rdquo; and with a
      wrist as graceful as the spring of a tigress he had the knife buried in
      Hogarth's left breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some instinct must have pierced Hogarth's sleep an instant before the
      actual blow, for while the knife was yet in him he had Harris's wrist; and
      the assassin fled writhing, so brisk a trick had cracked his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And blanched and short-breathed sprang Hogarth, but at once tottered,
      Margaret, open-mouthed, regarding him, till he suddenly cried out
      &ldquo;Ladies!&rdquo;, and before they came had hurried out, drawing his coat over the
      place of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second corridor he had to stop and lean, but then descended,
      striking all whom he passed with awe at his face, till he stumbled into
      his own drawing-room, and, as he fell, was caught by Sir Francis Yeames,
      the Private Secretary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wound had passed along the outer front surface of the second rib
      toward the scapula, injuring two of the branches of the axillary artery:
      so whispered the Resident Medical Attendant, while the council of doctors
      pronounced the condition &ldquo;very grave&rdquo;, but not &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo;&mdash;a case
      for &ldquo;judicious pressure&rdquo;; and after a long swoon he opened his eyes; in
      the deeply-recessed series of windows, narrow and round-topped, now dying
      the twilight; the insignificant bed lost in a chamber of frescoes and vast
      darksome oils of battles and loves. And, suddenly starting, he asked:
      &ldquo;What's the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven-thirty, my Lord King&rdquo;, answered Sir Martin Phipps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I remember: I was stabbed. Who did it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It can only be assumed from the evidence of a guardsman that it was a
      servant in the Palace, called Harris&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, I think I saw his face. Does anyone know of the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very few persons so far....The police are after Harris&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Regent started, understanding that the condemnation of Harris
      would mean a revelation of the Colmoor-horror secret; and he said after a
      minute, &ldquo;John, is that you? Will you go and have the whole thing
      quashed?....And now, doctor, the wound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wound is not what we call 'dangerous', my Lord King: ah, but believe
      me, it was a narrow shave&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say, Sir Martin: the outcomes of this particular world do arrive
      by narrow shaves; but they arrive, and life is an escape. At any rate,
      doctor, I shall be able to go, as arranged, to the Lords&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor smiled. &ldquo;No, never that&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall go&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at once he leapt from bed, staggering headlong in the effort, to
      strike his head against a window corner, while all ran, crying out, to
      catch him, the doctor thinking: &ldquo;Those whom the gods destroy they first
      drive mad&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      So far not a whisper of the stab had reached even the Prime Minister or
      the Prince; but since the news of moving troops, and the reluctance of the
      Lords to pass the Bill, agitated all, London came out to watch his descent
      upon the Lords.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in precisely the spirit of a professor who steps to the chair,
      smiles, and takes the class; but as he drove down Whitehall, this thought
      pierced him with a keener point than the steel of Harris: &ldquo;<i>The Sea...!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not know that at last a thousand transmitters, from Tarifa, from
      Frederikshavn, from many a ship, were thrilling the ether with messages as
      to the Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he know that that day Frankl had whispered to some dozen people,
      with proofs and old newspapers, that convict past of the Regent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And from his very first entering, when the Lord Chancellor rose, and the
      Regent made the bow, he was shocked by the scene of open insolence spread
      before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere the boldest eyes regarded him; he saw smiles of scorn, snarling
      visages, as, with reclining head and lowered lids, his eyes rested on the
      House: a hard gaze. Unfortunately, his pallor was perfectly obvious, and
      its significance, the stab being unknown, was misunderstood.
    </p>
    <p>
      And up rose a young lord, who stammered unprofundities just below the
      region of lawn-sleeves to the right; and another with slow step, as if to
      music, came up the gangway, and spoke at the table; and another after him:
      and it needed sustained effort to understand what they said; the brain, as
      it were, would not close upon statement after statement so insignificant.
      But Hogarth would have endured till midnight, or longer, but for a growing
      doubt within him: &ldquo;Am I bleeding? Shall I not certainly faint?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And there was this other question: &ldquo;To what greater daring of insolence
      will these impossible speeches rise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, at five minutes to ten, in the very midst of a duke's speech,
      the Regent, with dizzy brain, was on his feet: there was a few moments'
      gasp and breathlessness; and then&mdash;all at once&mdash;it was as though
      a wind from hell swept through that House, whirling in its vehemence
      Regent, lords, Gallery, Black Rod, Clerk, Usher, and all; and every face
      was marble, and every eye a blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Regent cried: &ldquo;Your lordships' eloquence&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he said &ldquo;eloquence&rdquo;, a voice that was a scream, a forward-straining
      form, a pointing finger: &ldquo;Why, my lords, that man is only a common
      convict!&mdash;reprieved for murder&mdash;escaped from Colmoor. And all
      his forts are sunk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It happened that in the midst of this outcry, the Regent fell back afaint,
      the moles black, the face white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, here seemed simple panic: and like a pack of dogs which rush to
      mangle a mongrel, they were at him pell-mell.
    </p>
    <p>
      See now a shocking scrimmage, a rush and crush for precedence, surge upon
      surge of men jostling each other in a struggle to get near him, sticks
      reaching awkwardly over heads to inflict far forceless blows, and on his
      face the fists; a hundred roaring &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;, fighting against the tide;
      three hundred shrieking, &ldquo;Kill him!&rdquo; &ldquo;Have him done with!&rdquo; &ldquo;Dash out his
      brains!&rdquo;, and pressing to that job. Sergeant-at-Arms, meanwhile,
      Clerk-attending-the-Table, and the physician, had run to give the alarm;
      but it was by one of those miracles of wild minutes, when turbulent
      sprites appear to mix themselves in the business of men, worse&mdash;embroiling
      the embroiled, that through the throng in the street rushed the word that
      the Regent was being killed: and quick, before any fatal blow had been
      struck, the rabble were there in that chamber, having brushed away every
      barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      They imagined themselves come to save: in reality they came to kill&mdash;were,
      in fact, too many for the area of the room, so that men succumbed fast as
      by plague-stroke under trampling feet, and even after twenty minutes when
      sixty-seven lay mangled the scene of horror could not be said to be ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early upon the irruption the physician, three policemen, a Reading Clerk,
      and the Bishop of Durham, had managed to extricate and drag the Regent
      out; and through the shouting of the outside crowd he was driven home
      unconscious.

    <h2>
      L &mdash; THE DECISION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Somewhat before this hour Admiral O'Hara had arrived at Croydon, a lust, a
      morbid curiosity, now working in this man&mdash;having committed the
      ineffable sin, to enjoy its fruit by hearing what Richard Hogarth now
      said, in what precise way he groaned, or raved, smiled, or wept, or
      stormed; for he was cruelly in love with Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the way had come with him the <i>Mahomet's</i> treasurer, with his bag
      of wealth&mdash;and two pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      So at Dieppe O'Harra had wired to Harris:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meet me at Croydon to-night, the 9.45 from Newhaven, as you love life.
      Most important. Shall expect wire from you at the London and Paris Hotel,
      Newhaven, not later than six, saying yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at Newhaven he had found no answer&mdash;Harris, in fact, not having
      received the telegram, having already inflicted his stab, and fled the
      Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon O'Hara, in an agony of doubt, had telegraphed Frankl from
      Newhaven:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For God's sake find Harris. Make him meet me at Croydon to-night in the
      9.45 from Newhaven. Do not fail&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Frankl knew exactly where Harris was&mdash;hiding in the Market
      Street house. And he said to himself: &ldquo;All right: it's got something to do
      with money, and a lot of it, too, with all this 'God's sake'. Suppose we
      <i>both</i> go to Croydon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hence Frankl missed the joy of seeing the Regent mobbed: for at 9.30 he
      was waiting with Harris on the Croydon up-platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the train stopped, they two hurried into the compartment where
      O'Hara sat alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, my friend?&rdquo; said O'Hara to Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Large as life&rdquo;, replied Frankl: &ldquo;I and the boy have already made it up
      between us for a third each: you a third, I a third, Alfie a third: that's
      fair; I keep the police off the backs of the pair of you, and you pay me a
      third. What's the figure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In one moment of silence O'Hara plotted; then his tongue yielded to the
      temptation of the great words: &ldquo;Eight-hundred-and-fifty thousand, sir&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      So after three minutes' talk Harris got out, and, as the train started,
      sprang into a first-class compartment in which was one other occupant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it was natural that the treasurer, carrying such a sum, should
      scrutinize any stranger, but Harris disarmed suspicion: his right arm,
      twisted by Hogarth, was in a sling, and he threw himself aside, and seemed
      to sleep, between the peak of his cap and his muffler hardly an inch of
      interval: so the treasurer, too, worn with travel, settled into a
      half-drowse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harris, however, like many of his type, was perfectly ambidextrous, often
      using the left hand by preference; and as the train passed Bromley, he
      darted, plunged his knife, streaked with the Regent's blood, into the
      treasurer's heart, and huddled the body under the seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      No stoppage till London Bridge, where, with the bag, Harris left the
      train, Frankl and O'Hara trotting after his burdened haste; and, after two
      changes of cabs, the three arrived at the Market Street house.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Harris laid the bag on the floor of an empty back room, where
      through a broken window came a little light, and the three stood looking
      down upon the bag, solemnly as upon a body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then suddenly Harris: &ldquo;Come, gentlemen of the jury, let's have my share of
      the dead meat: and 'ere's off out of it for this child&mdash;only this
      blooming arm of mine! it's going to get me nabbed as sure as sticks. Never
      mind&mdash;trot it out, Captain! and don't cheat an innocent orphan, lest
      the ravens of the valley pick out the yellow galls of some o' you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither of the other two, however, seemed anxious for the division; and
      after a minute's silence Frankl said: &ldquo;The third of 850, I <i>believe</i>,
      is 2, 8, 3; how are we going to carry away 283 thousand without something
      to put it in? I vote, Pat, that we leave the bag here, and come and divide
      at midnight sharp. How would that do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, said Harris, &ldquo;I think I see old Pat leaving the lot with me&mdash;what
      O! You know 'ow I'd fondle it for you, and keep it out of the cold, cold
      world, till you came back, don't you, you bald-headed priest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut your mouth, boy. We can't take it away without something, as Mr.
      Frankl very justly observes. Aren't there some safes, Frankl, in Adair
      Street?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right you are: and one, as I happen to know, empty. Who'll keep the key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, if you like, my friend. I'll keep the keys of the room-doors. And
      Harris will stand guard&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very thing&rdquo;, remarked Frankl.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was agreed. Harris took the bag; they descended to the cellar; then,
      striking matches, down three marl steps to the subterranean way made for
      Hogarth; and along it, forty feet, they stumbled bent, Harris gripped by
      each sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the Adair Street Board Room they lit a candle, and in the room
      next it found the safes, the largest of which admitting the bag, Frankl
      locked its door, took the key; O'Hara then locked the room door, took the
      key; and at the stair-bottom locked another door, took the key; so that
      Frankl could not now get at the bag without him, nor he without Frankl,
      nor Harris without both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two then went away, while Harris, sprawling cynically on a solitary chair
      down in the parlour with straight open legs, awaited the <i>rendezvous</i>
      at twelve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not, however, sat very long, when the taper at his feet glared on a
      face of terror at a sound of ghosts in the tomb that the house was, and he
      started to his feet, prone, snatching his knife&mdash;thinking, as always,
      of the Only Reality, the police. But he had not prowled three ecstatic
      steps when O'Hara stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, damned fool!&rdquo; he went with infinite contempt and reproach, &ldquo;to
      frighten anybody like that! What's it you are after now? Frighten anybody
      like that....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Alfie</i>!&rdquo;&mdash;O'Hara whispered it breathfully as the hoarse
      sirocco, stepping daintily like the peacock. Tell it not in Gath! If Alfie
      rammed the knife into the marrow of Frankl's back at the moment when the
      safe was opened, then Alfie would have, not a third, but a half; and the
      thing was desirable for this reason: that a half is greater than a
      third...
    </p>
    <p>
      Harris saw that: but he seemed reluctant, meditating upon the ground; then
      walking, hands in pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, boy, he is only an interloper&rdquo;, said O'Hara: &ldquo;I meant the money to
      be divided fairly between you and me. Why should this Jew come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&rdquo;, said Harris: &ldquo;I don't mind&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I know a little castle in Granada, Alfie, which we'll buy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right: you go away. It's agreed&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And O'Hara hurried away, took a cab, drove for the Palace; while Harris,
      left alone, sat serious, with sprawling straight legs, and presently
      muttered: &ldquo;Blind me, I must be going dotty or something! p'raps it's this
      arm....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had not thought of killing Frankl, until it had been suggested!&mdash;some
      class-habit, or instinct, of honour among thieves (which, however, his
      reason despised)...But five minutes after O'Hara had gone he started
      alert, staring, with tight fist, and, &ldquo;All right, you two&rdquo;, said he,
      &ldquo;blood it is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat again: and again, after twenty minutes, the house gave a sound&mdash;Frankl,
      who had let himself in by the front door, each member possessing a key to
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Alf&rdquo;, said he, &ldquo;all alone? Then, we two can have a little chat
      between us little two&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he stood and talked, while Harris sprawled and listened, Frankl's road
      to his end being more circuitous than O'Hara's, more hedged, too, with
      reasons, scruples, sanctions: but he reached it, pointing out that a half
      is greater than a third; also that O'Hara would be a continual witness
      against Harris' past, whereas he, Frankl, left England for Asia the next
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alfie pretended aversion to bloodshed, but finally consented; upon which
      Frankl went away, and took cab for Scotland Yard: his idea being to have
      Harris arrested red-handed in the murder of O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      The streets through which he drove wore a singular aspect&mdash;of
      commotion, hurry, unrest, two dragoon-orderlies galloping past him at the
      Marble Arch, in Whitehall the tramp of some line-regiment battalion, and
      he said to himself: &ldquo;He is going to fight it out with them, I suppose&mdash;Satan
      take the lot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Scotland Yard he said to the Inspector in Charge, having given his
      card, that if two officers were placed at his disposition, he might be
      able to lead them to the arrest of a man long &ldquo;wanted&rdquo;, who now
      premeditated another murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, O'Hara was in conversation with Loveday in the Regent's library,
      nearer the centre of which stood a group of four with their heads together&mdash;Prime
      Minister, First Lord, War Office Secretary, a Naval Lord; further still, a
      spurred General, cloaked over his out-stuck sword, writing, with a wet
      white brow; and, &ldquo;I suppose he will want to see you&rdquo;, said Loveday, &ldquo;if
      you have anything to say. But the doctors have first to be reckoned with:
      I suppose you know that he has been stabbed and beaten&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stabbed! by whom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Harris&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This afternoon&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! I did not know&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was by your recommendation, it appears, that Harris became Captain
      Macnaghten's servant&rdquo;, said Loveday with his smile, looking very gaunt and
      bent-down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, sir!&rdquo;&mdash;from O'Hara&mdash;&ldquo;you are not my judge: I am here to
      see the Lord of the Sea, my King&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;you still give him the title&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now O'Hara, drawing his chair nearer to ask: &ldquo;<i>How did he take it?</i>&rdquo;
       stretching back the waiting mouth to hear that thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord Regent? Well, at eight-thirty he went to the House of Lords,
      where they beat him nearly to death on the throne, the gentle hearts, and
      the doctors forbade me to speak to him of the Sea; but his eyes seemed to
      question me, so I leant over, and told him&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and whatever did he say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He said: &ldquo;'What, old Pat?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara rose to stand by a hearth, black-robed to the heels and tonsured,
      and at the angle of his jaw some sinews ribbed and moved: not a syllable
      now from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going in now to him&rdquo;, said Loveday: &ldquo;if you care to wait here, I
      will see&rdquo;&mdash;and passing through a palace pretty busy that night with
      feet and a thousand working purposes, went to sit at the sick bed, the
      doctors retiring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is the pain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pain&rdquo;, said the Regent very weakly, &ldquo;is nonsense: I am not going to
      be bullied by doctors, but shall do exactly as I like&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is that, Richard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a Normandy village, John, called Valée-les-Noisettes&mdash;white
      houses with an extraordinary sound of forest about, one of Poussin's
      landscapes, with a smithy under a chestnut precisely as in the poem; and
      the blacksmith is a charming man. I dare say someone will find me money
      enough to purchase a share of his smithy: and with him I shall work,
      starting for him before sunrise, with my sister&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loveday, wondering if he was delirious, said irrelevantly: &ldquo;I have to tell
      you that by five A.M. there will be 15,000 additional infantry in London,
      with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I wish they'd lend them me to send out to those poor Jews, John. But,
      for myself&mdash;I was mad when I gave that order. It won't do! the world
      is addicted to its orbit, and relapses. I don't say that it will be always
      so, but it is now. As against the Empire of the Sea arises&mdash;Pat
      O'Hara; as against the brushing aside of these rebels arise&mdash;Germany,
      Russia, the hostile world. Consider the rancour of the nations at
      Britain's late advantages in sea-rent, try to conceive the scream of
      jubilation that rings to the sky to-night against her, and against me. Do
      you think I could <i>now</i> start a civil war in England? for the
      satisfaction of my own pride? I call God to witness that never for my own
      pride have I done aught, but that the Kingdom of God might come. I know
      that bitter tears will flow at the fall of the righteous man&mdash;many
      calling me 'traitor' for abandoning those ready to die for me. Yet it
      shall be. I never thought to fail, to fly, John Loveday, chased by such
      little fellows: but God has done it. Well, then, the smithy. You and all,
      therefore, will find enough to do to-night&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loveday lifted a face streaming with tears to say: &ldquo;The man, O'Hara, waits
      to see you&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? Well, come, we will see him....&rdquo; and in some minutes O'Hara was
      there by the bedside, the eyes of the two fixed together, over Hogarth's
      face five oblongs of sticking-plaster, his head bandaged, and at a corner
      of O'Hara's mouth a twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pat, did you betray me?&rdquo; asked Hogarth.
    </p>
    <p>
      O'Hara nodded: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may sit and tell me, and ease your poor heart&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And a long time O'Hara sat, going into the mighty crime, torturing
      details, revelling in the vastness of the horror, the sickness of the
      self-inflicted filth, and pangs of the self-inflicted scalpel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why did you do it, my friend?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I worship you....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, perhaps I understand you, crooked soul. But what will you do now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see. What will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to France to live as a private person&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tut, you remain as simple as a child: the earth's not large enough to
      contain you, you couldn't now remain a private person for three weeks.
      Come, I have discrowned you: I will give you another crown, though I shall
      never see you wear it. Why not go to your own people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Jews&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't talk that same madness&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My time with you is short, Raphael Spinoza&rdquo;&mdash;O'Hara glanced at his
      watch&mdash;&ldquo;in five minutes we part, never, I do assure you, to meet
      again. Listen, then, to me: you are a Jew. I knew your mother&mdash;the
      most intellectual woman, I suppose, who ever drew breath, the only one
      whom I have loved; and I should have known you merely from your
      resemblance to her at my first glance at you in Colmoor, though I had more
      precise data: the three moles, the bloodshot eye, for didn't I baptize
      you? haven't I rocked you in my arms? You know St. Hilda on the hill over
      Westring, which you found me examining that morning after our escape from
      the prison? I was priest there, three years, and twice I have confessed
      her&mdash;ah! and remember it! for when your foster-father wanted her to
      turn Methodist, she wouldn't stand that, and since she must needs be a <i>meshumad</i>
      (apostate), became a Catholic. Well, now, I once saw at Thring, and once
      in the <i>Boodah</i>, an old goat-hair trunk of yours: what is become of
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have it&mdash;&rdquo; Hogarth was shivering, his eyes wide, and in his memory
      a strange singsong crooning of <i>t'hillim</i>, heard ages before in some
      other world over a cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know that that trunk has a false bottom?&rdquo; asked O'Hara.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you knew...And have you never seen a bundle of papers under it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I assumed them to be old farm-accounts....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all the proofs you need concerning your birth; it is <i>my</i>
      trunk by the way&mdash;Ah, I must go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door he fastened upon Hogarth a last reluctant gaze to say
      good-bye, but Hogarth, staring wildly afar, did not turn his eyes, and
      O'Hara, with a sigh, was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drove to Adair Street, and, as he passed by a mews, Frankl, waiting
      there with two detectives, saw him by a street-light, but made no remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      When O'Hara entered the house, he looked about for Harris, but Harris had
      gone to the lodging of a woman in James Street near, to arrange a
      hiding-place for the bag, passing out through the Market Street house; and
      O'Hara, opening the two locked doors, entered the safe-room, where he
      stood waiting, his forehead low, resting on the steel top; and now a sob
      throbbed through his frame, and his lips let out &ldquo;...<i>so lovely...so
      great</i>....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Count a minute's stillness: and now the man's soul and being foundered in
      a storm of sorrow, and half-words borne on shivering puffs of breath, and
      choking groans, broke the stillness: &ldquo;My Liege! Richard! my King!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This died to silence; and now he roamed the room with furious steps, and
      lowering brow, and an out-pushed under-lip, until, deciding, he drew from
      his pocket a penknife, opened it, leant now one elbow on the safe-top,
      blade in hand, considered, considered, hesitating, then with lifted chin
      and the thinnest whimpering like a puppy, pretty pitiful, cut from under
      his left ear to the chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly a hurt so shallow could never have killed, for the hand had been
      cherishingly restrained, and the thing was no sooner done than the priest,
      seeing that he did not die, ran horror-eyed, streaming with blood,
      shouting a hoarse whisper: &ldquo;Help! help! help!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But at that cry he sighed, fell back, and effectually died, his heart
      pierced by the knife of Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      And some moments later the face of Frankl, who bore a candle, looked in at
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all right, Alfie?&rdquo;&mdash;in the weakest whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on in, and don't ask any questions&rdquo;, said Harris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankl entered, peered upon the dead visage of the priest; then, the
      detectives being now behind the parlour-door below, with handcuffs, rose
      to run to summon them: but, to his horror, Harris was now before the door;
      he saw in the candlelight those eyes of Alfie fixed upon him: and he knew:
      before the least threat or movement by Harris, the Jew sent to Heaven a
      piercing shriek, his hour come....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;...dirty-livered Jew...&rdquo; striking in the breast, and, as Frankl fell, he
      gave him one other in the temple, with &ldquo;Down, down to hell, and sye <i>I</i>
      sent thee thither&rdquo;; and to dead O'Hara near he gave one in the cheek, with
      &ldquo;Go up, thou bald-head, it <i>is</i>&rdquo;: all in two seconds' space; and he
      was now about to turn anew to hack at Frankl, when his keen ear heard a
      creak; and he sprang up a spinning motionlessness&mdash;the Reality before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And instantly on the realization of that fact, he was submissive,
      reverent, as before the very Helmet of Pallas, goddess of Blue; and said
      he with sullen dejection, reverent of the Helmet, but easy with the man:
      &ldquo;All right: you've beat me...I suppose it's that Regent-stabbing affair
      brought you: it was I did it all right&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they went down, almost from the door a crowd gathered, pressing
      close, Harris' hands and front all red from O'Hara's throat; and when one
      policeman, big with the fact, whispered a gentleman: &ldquo;You may have heard,
      sir, that the Regent was stabbed to-day&mdash;it's been kept precious
      dark, but the fact's so: this is the beauty as done it&rdquo;, like loosened
      effluvia that news flew&mdash;but distorted, largened&mdash;the stains
      were Regent's blood!&mdash;and beyond measure had the crowd spread ere it
      reached the Edgware Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      There at the corner, as the officers looked about for a cab, and one blew
      a whistle, a man reached out and fiercely struck Harris on the face, while
      another shouted: &ldquo;Lynch the beggar!&rdquo;; and now arose a hustling, huddled
      impulses, and now in full vogue that grave noising of congregations when
      the voice of God jogs them; while Harris, excessively pallid, handcuffed,
      began to whistle; a number of other police now seeking the crowd's centre,
      but with difficulty; a cab, too, slowly making a way which closed like
      water round it: and when this had nearly reached him, Harris, in his
      eagerness to get in, sprang far toward it&mdash;and slipped. He never rose
      again: the crowd rolled over his last howl, and in the midst of a great
      row as of hounds, trampled him to a paste.
    </p>
    <p>
      About that very time that better man whom he had stabbed, in tying up in
      bed a bundle of old papers, was saying: &ldquo;Yes, I will go to my people&rdquo;....
    </p>
    <p>
      And by six A.M. he was up, in his study, dressed, looking quite owlish
      with his excess of eyes, which, however, danced at the first news of the
      morning&mdash;the arrival at Portsmouth of the <i>Boodah II</i>., which
      had raced like a carrier-bird since 8.30 P.M. of the 29th, full of the
      news of the vanished <i>Mahomet</i>: on her being 200 marines.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he spoke through the telephone with various Government-offices,
      early astir that morning, till the Private Secretary looked in with the
      announcement that his train would be ready in ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His last act in the Palace was the sending to the Treasurer at Jerusalem,
      for Miss Frankl, the telegram:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
   &ldquo;Be surprised, but believe: I am a Jew.&rdquo;
                   &ldquo;RICHARD&rdquo;.
</pre>
    <p>
      Of the Household some fifty, catching wind of what was toward, offered,
      even begged, to go with him; but in general he refused, and set out with a
      suite of only seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached Hastings at twenty minutes to ten, where, to the disgust of
      all, the region of Central Station was found crowded; whereupon Sir
      Francis Yeames held a consultation with a local rector, and a dash was
      made to a private hotel near the pier.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, looking from behind window curtains at eleven, Hogarth saw before a
      paper-shop:
    </p>
    <p>
      FLIGHT OF THE REGENT
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute afterwards he started backward from the splintered window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was known:
    </p>
    <p>
      LIFE-HISTORY OF THE CONVICT HOGARTH MARVELLOUS DETAILS
    </p>
    <p>
      The street, to its two vanishing-points, was one scene of hats, mixed with
      upturned faces: and it was an aggressive crowd that gave out a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not till noon did the <i>Boodah II.</i> arrive; and then there was no
      setting out&mdash;all the front windows of the house now broken, and in
      the town a row like the feeding-time of lions, which uttered &ldquo;coward&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;murderer&rdquo;, &ldquo;convict&rdquo;, &ldquo;traitor&rdquo;. Hogarth had been put to bed, the two
      ladies were in a state of scare, Margaret anon crying on Loveday's
      shoulder, declaring that &ldquo;<i>He</i>&rdquo; (meaning Frankl) was in the crowd,
      and coming, coming, boring his way: she had seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, near four P.M., a portion of the yard-wall at the back was broken
      down by the party, Hogarth was raised and dressed, and through the breach
      the party passed into another back-yard, then made beachward, Hogarth
      leaning on the arm of Sir Martin Phipps; but they had no sooner come to
      the Esplanade than they were surrounded, and when, on their attaining the
      pier, the pier-turnstile was closed against the mob, it was impossible to
      conceive whence so many missiles came. Once Hogarth stopped, faced round,
      looked at them, but now a pebble bruised his left temple, and he dropped,
      fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caught up by Sir Martin, Loveday, Sir Francis Yeames, and Colonel Lord
      Hallett of the body-guard, he was hurried, a hanging concave with
      abandoned head, to the long-waiting boat, and it was in a scurry of
      escape, out of stroke, that the oarsmen rowed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yonder lay the yacht with her fires banked, and was soon under weigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had started, when a harbour-master's motor-boat was observed giving
      chase, in her an officer from Scotland Yard who bore a bag, found by means
      of the key in Frankl's pocket in the Adair Street safe; on its clasp the
      name &ldquo;Mahomet&rdquo;, and it contained £850,000: so that the yacht went wealthy
      on her way.

    <h2>
      LI. &mdash; THE MODEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The voyage to Palestine was marked by two events: one the stoppage at
      Tarifa, where the five hundred from the <i>Mahomet</i> were, these, when
      taken on board the <i>Boodah II.</i>, making an armed force of 700; and
      then, toward sunset of the fifth day, a steamer exchanged signals with the
      <i>Boodah II.</i>, enquired after the whereabouts of the Lord of the Sea,
      received the reply &ldquo;on board&rdquo;, and when she stopped it turned out that she
      had on board a Jewish Petition urging upon Spinoza to come and throw in
      his lot with them. And here again was that name of Rebekah, spelled now
      Ribkah.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the news of his fall&mdash;the fact that he was a Jew&mdash;had
      created a mighty stirring in Israel, of wonder, of the pride of race.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the seventh day the yacht was off the Palestine coast, and Joppa,
      seated on her cliffs, appeared over a foaming roadstead. But when a
      landing was effected, they were to hear that there had been a collision on
      the Jerusalem-Joppa railway, the line blocked, travel suspended; so, as
      the filthy town was congested, the Royal party took refuge in a great
      restaurant-tent, set up by a Polish Jew in gaberdine and fur cap, who
      vociferated invitation at the door. All was mud, beggary, narrowness,
      chaos, picturesque woe. Yet work had commenced: between the upper and the
      nether millstone a woman ground corn at a doorway; the camel passed
      loaded; the dragoman went with quicker step. In the afternoon Spinoza,
      wandering beyond the outskirts of the town, saw in an orange-grove,
      sitting before a roofless hut, six diligent two-handed Jews exhaustively
      drawing the cord of the cobbler; further still, and saw what could only
      have been a Petticoat-Lane Jew ploughing with a little cow and a camel:
      and he smiled, thanking God, and taking courage&mdash;had always loved
      this land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he procured a number of clumsy waggons, with horses,
      asses, camels, and provisions; and his caravan set out, to travel all day
      over a plain, a &ldquo;goodly land,&rdquo; the almond-tree in blossom, orange and
      olive, everywhere lilies, the scarlet anemone, he considering himself so
      familiar with the way, that he was their only guide, though the morning
      was misty; and through the plain of Sharon they wended over the worst
      roads in existence, until, passing into a country of rocks, they made out
      afar the mountains of Judæa, whose patches of white stone look like snow
      in sunshine, on the roads streams of wayfarers, tending all eastward to
      Jerusalem, lines of camels and waggons, pedestrians with wine-skins,
      mother and sucking child on the solitary ass, and the Bedouin troop; but
      Spinoza was all solitary among fastnesses on the third forenoon when he
      muttered nervously: &ldquo;I must certainly have lost the way&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he called halt, and the caravan turned back to re-find the road,
      Spinoza prying on camel-back foremost, clad now in the caftan and white
      robes of the Orient.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all day the caravan wandered out of the track in a white sea of mist:
      no farmstead, nor cot, but the wild vine, and the wild fig, and twice a
      telegraph-tree, still with its bark on, and the abandoned hold of a
      bandit-sheik. Finally, near six P.M., Spinoza, finding himself in a
      valley-bottom, sent out the order to pitch camp: upon which the tents were
      fixed near a brook, waggons grouped around, and animals picketed to grass.
      Spinoza, the two ladies, and Loveday, then ate together at the door of one
      tent; after which he rose and strolled away, thinking how best to handle
      this crab of Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed that the mist was lifting a little; and suddenly, as he
      strolled, he stood still, listening: for remote tones of singing or
      mourning seemed to meet his ear&mdash;from the west: and in some moments
      more he saw the Mount of Olives&mdash;to the west, not, as he believed
      that it must be, to the east, he having, in fact, in losing his way from
      the coast, passed by Jerusalem to the north; and on the other side of the
      Mount of Olives, from its foot to the Brook Kedron, spread at that moment
      over the Valley of Jehosophat an innumerable multitude, covered in
      praying-shawls, many prostrate, many with the keen and stressful face of
      supplication lifted in appeal to God, that He would visit His people, and
      turn again in this latter day to His lost and helpless flock. Every child
      of Israel who could contrive it, at whatever cost, was there, since it was
      the prophesied day of&mdash;&ldquo;the Coming&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a bold woman, summoning her fainting strength, bracing her trembling
      knee, stepped a little up the hillside to fling high her hand as a sign&mdash;Rebecca
      Frankl, celebrated now through Israel as the elect of the sibyl Estrella;
      and at that signal the congregation, gazing keenly into heaven, lifted up
      their voice in meek song, singing the sibyl's &ldquo;Hymn to the Messiah&rdquo;:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The oceans trudge and tire their soul, desiring Thee; and night-winds
      homeless roam with dole, reproaching Thee; the clouds aspire, and find no
      goal, and gush for Thee, reproaching Thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou scrawled'st 'I mean' in rocks and men, in trends and streams; the
      prophets raved, to sages' ken Thou shewed'st dreams; Thou shrouded'st dark
      the How and When in starry schemes, and trends and streams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The jungles blare, the glebe-lands low and bleat for Thee; the
      generations rage and go, agaze for Thee; creation travaileth in woe, with
      groans for Thee, agaze for Thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adonai, come! with crashing rote of chariots come; or moonlight-mild,
      alone, afloat, Messussah, come; with floods of lutes, or thundering
      throat, but come! O, come! Messussah come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Arctics hawk-up their haunted heart, and raucous, spue; and
      north-winds, wawling calls, outstart, to droop anew; the clouds like
      scouts updart, depart, and truceless do, and droop anew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long! They breeds have waited fain what sibyls ween; Thou
      scribbled'st in their secret brain 'I scheme; I mean'; the constellations
      stray and strain: Break out! be seen what sibyls ween&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pampas stamp and, nomad, low, reposeless, lone; raging the
      generations trow, and drudge, and drown; a anguished glance this latter
      woe throws to Thy Throne, reposeless, lone&rdquo;...
    </p>
    <p>
      Before them, above them, as they sang stood&mdash;a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard by a wall of that Moslem mosque, once a chapel which marked the
      supposed spot of &ldquo;the Ascension&rdquo;, he stood, in an attitude of suspense,
      astonishment, his body half-twisted&mdash;Spinoza.
    </p>
    <p>
      An instant, and he was aware of Jerusalem lying &ldquo;as a city that is
      compact&rdquo; before him&mdash;not to the east&mdash;to the west! Yet another
      instant, and he realized that the whole tract of humanity&mdash;man,
      woman, child&mdash;was on its face before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A faintness overcame him, shame, dismay; then, his blood now rushing to
      his brow, his mouth sent out the passionate shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to <i>me!</i> Not to <i>me! I am the Lord of the Sea....!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the people heard this, saw him, knew him, they remained in
      adoration....
    </p>
    <p>
      By a special ship they had sent him a petition to come; here he was weeks
      sooner than ship or airship could have conveyed him: and they took him as
      the answer to their supplication, the answer which Heaven willed, in the
      sure and certain faith that he would cure their ache, and the ache of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      An acclamation like the voice of many waters arose and rolled below him,
      and on the bosom of that tumult he moved among them into the Holy City, as
      darkness covered all.
    </p>

    <p>
      He took the title of Shophet, or Judge, and for sixty years ruled over
      Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that the initial &ldquo;pull&rdquo; over other nations possessed by
      Israel (in respect of the sea-forts remaining in the Gulf of Aden, Yellow
      Sea, Western Pacific) was the cause of his rise as of some thrice-ardent
      Star of the Morning and asterisk dancing in the dawn's dark: for the other
      nations, timorous of one another, made never an attempt to build; but, for
      our share, we insist that anyway Judæa was bound to become what she became&mdash;indeed,
      sea-rent after the Regency collapse was decreased at the three forts, and
      suddenly in the twelfth year of his judgeship Spinoza ordered its
      stoppage.
    </p>
    <p>
      By which period the University of Jerusalem had become the chief
      nerve-centre of the world's research and upward effort: for in creating a
      &ldquo;civilized State&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;proud and happy&rdquo;&mdash;Spinoza did it with that
      spinning rapidity of the modernization of Japan, so that in whatever
      respects it was not a question of months, it was a question of not many
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      For, as in the soul of the Jewish people abode as before that genius for
      righteousness which wrote the Bible, and as the soul of righteousness lies
      even in this; Thou shalt not steal, therefore Israel with some little pain
      attained to this: whereupon with startling emphasis was brought to pass
      that statement: &ldquo;Righteousness exalteth a nation&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the promise says: &ldquo;I will put a new spirit within them&rdquo;; and this&mdash;very
      rapidly&mdash;found fulfilment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whereupon others fast, faster, found fulfilment, so that a stale and
      bitter word was in Pall Mall, saying: &ldquo;The lot of them seem to have formed
      themselves into a syndicate to run the prophecies&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the promise has it: &ldquo;I shall be with them&rdquo;; and again: &ldquo;They shall
      be a cleansed nation&rdquo;; and again: &ldquo;They shall fear Him&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      The transformation was rapid for the reason that it was natural, seeing
      that it had been Europe only that, like a Circe, had bewitched them into
      beastial shapes, &ldquo;sharks&rdquo;, and &ldquo;bulls&rdquo;, and &ldquo;bears&rdquo;, mediæval Jews, for
      example, having been debarred from every pursuit save commerce: so that
      Shylock was obliged to turn into a Venetian; and, in ceasing to be a
      Hebrew, became more Venetian than the Venetians, for the reason that he
      had more brains, ready to beat them at any game they cared to mention; but
      the genuine self of Shylock was a vine-dresser or sandal-maker, as Hillel
      was a wood-chopper, David a shepherd, Amos a fig-gatherer, Saul an
      ass-driver, Rabbi Ben Zakkai a sail-maker, Paul a tent-maker: so that the
      return to simplicity and honesty was quickly accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, that done, behold a wonder: at the whirling of a wand the swine
      of Circe converted back to biped man; whereupon without fail whatsoever he
      does it shall astonishingly prosper: that succession of wits, seers,
      savants, Heines, Einsteins, inspired mouths, pens of iridium, brushes from
      the archangel's plumage, discoveries, new Americas, elations, sensations&mdash;in
      therapeutics&mdash;in aero-nautics-beyond-the-atmosphere&mdash;in the
      powers involved in sub-atoms&mdash;in the powers, latent till now,
      involved in soul...for now each of millions was free to think, free to
      manifest his own particular luck and knack in discovery, having a country,
      foothold, not hovering like Noah's dove, urging still the purposeless wing
      not to pitch into nowhere: for the promise says: &ldquo;Ye shall not sow and
      another reap, ye shall not plant and another garner&rdquo;, but in a land of
      gentlemen ye shall live, as it were to swellings of music, while a noble
      height grows upon your smooth foreheads, and the sum-total of the blending
      movements of your bodies and brains shall, as seen from heaven, appear the
      minuet of a people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within forty years mighty works had been done: forts, irrigation of
      deserts, reclamation of the Dead Sea, passionate temples clapped to the
      lower clouds about the perpetual lamp, and that baroque Art of the Orient
      which at the Judges progresses in Summer through the country would draw
      multitudes of foreigners to gape at so great pomp, at Corinthian cities
      full of grace and riches which had arisen to crown with many crowns that
      plain of Mesopotamia, and where desolate Tyre had mourned her purples, and
      old Tadmor in the Wilderness (Palmyra) had sat in dirt; to gape, too, at a
      Jerusalem which in twenty years had crossed the Valley of Jehosophat, and
      might really then be called &ldquo;the Golden&rdquo;, a purged Babylon, a London burnt
      to ashes and rebuilt somewhere else: for the Shophet proved true Duke and
      Leader, born mountaineer, climbing from pinnacle to wild pinnacle, becking
      his people after him with many a meaningful gesture skyward and suggesting
      smile; and Israel followed his thrilling way, hearing always the Excelsior
      of his calling as it were the voice direct of Heaven. What no merits of
      his could give, the land which he had chosen gave, Mesopotamia pretty soon
      proving herself a treasury of mineral riches: here is bdellium and the
      onyx-stone; and where the streaming Pison, dawdling, draws his twine of
      waters over that happy valley of Havilah, there is gold&mdash;hoard stored
      from before the Eozoic, as misers bury for their heirs, in mine and
      friable quarry, rollick rain: &ldquo;and the gold of <i>that</i> land is good&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was not merely progress, but progress at increasing speed&mdash;acceleration&mdash;finally
      resembling flight, as of eagle or phoenix, eye fixed on the sun: Tyre by
      the fiftieth year having grown into the biggest of ports, her quays
      unloading 6,700,000 tons a year, mart of tangled masts, felucca, galiot,
      junk, cargoes of Tarshish and the Isles, Levantine stuffs, spice from the
      Southern Sea; while Jerusalem had grown into the recognized school of the
      wealthier youth of Europe, Asia and America.
    </p>
    <p>
      For it says: &ldquo;The Kings of the earth shall bring their honour and glory
      unto her&rdquo;; and again: &ldquo;She shall reign gloriously&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not Israel alone reaped the fruits of his own fine weather, but his
      dews fell wide. For it says: &ldquo;They shall be as dew from the Lord&rdquo;; and
      again: &ldquo;They shall fill the face of the earth with fruit&rdquo;; and again: &ldquo;All
      nations shall call them blessed&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it was: for the example of Israel, his suasive charm, proved
      compelling as sunshine to shoots, so that that heart of Spinoza lived to
      see the spectacle of a whole world deserting the gory path of Rome to go
      up into those uplands of mildness and gleefulness whither invites the
      smile of that lily Galilean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mission of &ldquo;unbelieving&rdquo; Israel was to convert Christendom to
      Christianity: and this he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      We watch the Judge coming down the Mount of Olives in the midst of a
      jubilant throng all involved in a noise of timbrels and instruments of
      music: for his life was simple and one with the life of his people. It is
      evening, all the west yonder a bewitched Kingdom charm-embathed, wherein a
      barge of Venus bethronged with loves and roses voyages on a sea of
      dalliance en route for the last Beatific&mdash;the last, the seventh,
      Heaven&mdash;whitherward gads all a pilgrim-swarm of enraptured spirits,
      all, all thitherward, Paul caught up with clothes aflaunt, and soaring
      eagle, Enoch transfigured, green hippogriff, hop of squatted frog; and
      thitherward trots with blinkings, bleating, the Ram of the Golden Fleece,
      the flagrant flamingos flap and go.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Judge, hoary-headed now, in a robe of cloth-of-silver which rippled,
      had but now got home from a Pilgrimage; and the time was Simcath Torah,
      the Rejoicing of the Law, and the carrying of Candles, in the month.
      Tishri: silver his robe and silver his hair that hung round a brown and
      puckered skin, but silvery, too, his every tooth still, and his vigour
      good; and, as down the Mount of Olives he stepped, he saw Mount Sion and
      that Temple that he had piled, across whose roughened frontispiece of gold
      glowed in a bow, bold like the rainbow's, in characters of blazing
      sapphire and chrysoprase, that inscription:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Y'HOVAH B'KOKMAR YSAD ARETS, CONEN SHAMAIM B'THBUNAH&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      and, as he saw it, lo, buoyancy caught the old man's feet: for the
      cymballing and music had grown very fiercely hot, so that all the
      congregation reeled in dance; and as the lasso drops round the astonished
      prairie-horse and draws asprawl, so dancing caught and drew his foot, and
      he danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his wife Rebecca, mother of many sons, prying from a window-lattice,
      writhed odd the eyebrows of the cynic, one beyond the other: for not with
      foot alone he danced, but his wrung belly laboured in that travail of
      Orient dancing; and she turned and smiled to Margaret Loveday a
      turned-down smile, implying shrug, implying girding, her eyelids lowered,
      yet indulgent of his nature's rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not with foot and abdomen alone he danced, but his two balancing palms
      danced to the beat of the heat of the music's heart; and with heel and toe
      he danced. And as he danced, he sang, all apant, filling up with
      nonsense-sounds when the rhythm's imperative tramp outran his
      improvisation; and singing he danced, and dancing sang: with abdomen and
      arms he danced, and with toe and heel he danced.
    </p>
    <p>
      And dancing he sang:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  My hands,
  be dancing to God,
  your Guide,
    And peal my pipes,
    and riot my feet,
    and writhe to His Heat,
    my tripes.
  So fair!
  With Rum-te-te-Tum
  te Tum,
    And Rum and Tum,
    and Rum-te-te-Tum,
    and Rum-te-te-Tum,
    te Tum.
  So fair!
  This freehold for seraphs free!
    That flame! those skies!
    and Blest is Her Name,
    and blest are my eyes,
    that see.
</pre>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 I'll dance,
 I'll dance like a ram,
 for fun,
   I'll smack the sun,
   I'll dance at the breeze
   I'll dance till I breed
   a son.
 For Thou!
 Thou bringest Thine ends
 to pass:
   This hump so high,
   this lump and her sigh,
   Thou lead'st through the Nee-
   dle's Eye.
 'Tis well
 the saurians sprawled,
 and roared!
   'Tis well Thou art!
   and well that Thou wast,
   and well when at last
   they soared!
 And well,
 O well that Thou art
 to be
   When seraph hearts
   will laugh by this brook,
   and break for the love
   of Thee.
 Thy years
 shall still by increase
 te Tum,
   And dance and dance,
   With Rum-te-te-Tum....
</pre>
    <p>
      so, singing, he danced, and, dancing, sang; and their sounds grew faint;
      and they entered into the City of Glory, and their sounds failed....
    </p>
    <p>
      They took him for the Sent of Heaven, nor did the results of his glorious
      reign gainsay such a notion: the good Loveday, indeed, had the agreeable
      fancy that our greatest are really One, who eternally runs the circle of
      incarnation after incarnation from hoary old ages till now&mdash;the
      Ancient of Days, his hair white like wool, quietly turning up anew when
      the time yearns, and men are near to yield to the enemy: Proteus his name,
      and ever the shape he takes is strange, unexpected, yet ever sharing the
      same three traits of vision, rage and generousness&mdash;the Slayer of the
      Giant&mdash;Arthur come back&mdash;the Messenger of the Covenant&mdash;the
      genius of our species&mdash;Jesus the Oft-Born.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
